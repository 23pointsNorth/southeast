2016-12-14,10:00am ET,Sound sheds light: How side scan sonar helps advance the aquatic conservation mission,"With access to low-cost, side imaging sonar and the development of tools and techniques for processing and analyzing data within a GIS framework, the opportunity to investigate and develop applications that address pressing conservation needs in navigable aquatic systems has never been greater.  Across the Florida Panhandle the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating the use of side scan sonar to detect and enumerate large sturgeons as an alternative approach for monitoring long-term trends in abundance as the species recovers.  Within a meandering portion of the Apalachicola River, we have demonstrated the use of this technology to define suitable mussel habitat and assess changes in habitat over time, and have used easily derived habitat metrics to model the distribution and abundance of an endangered species of mussel.  In these cases, side scan sonar provided highly detailed, meso-scale level information about the subsurface environment; such information is critical to advancing our aquatic conservation mission in the 21st century.","Adam Kaeser* (USFWS – Panama City, FL), Frank Parauka (USFWS, retired), Reuben Smit (Auburn University)",Southeast Aquatic Resources Conservation Science and Practice,,https://www.fws.gov/panamacity/sonarhabitatmapping.html,https://mmancusa.webex.com/mmancusa/ldr.php?RCID=eebd2ae0101b5ff5c1cd0cbd22fef2eb,side-scan-sonar-survey-setup.jpg,Sean Sterrett,Low-cost side scan sonar survey setup,2016-12-14-kaeser-sound-sheds-light.pdf,,
2017-01-11,10:00am ET,Landscape scale assessment of floodplain inundation frequency using Landsat imagery,"In large river ecosystems, the timing, extent, duration and frequency of floodplain inundation greatly affects the quality of fish and wildlife habitat and the supply of important ecosystem goods and services. Seasonal high flows provide connectivity from the river to the floodplain and seasonal inundation of the floodplain governs ecosystem structure and function. River regulation and other forms of hydrologic alteration have altered the connectivity of many rivers with their adjacent floodplain – impacting the function of wetlands on the floodplain and in turn, impacting the mainstem river function. Conservation and management of remaining floodplain resources can be improved through a better understanding of the spatial extent and frequency of inundation at scales that are relevant to the species and/or ecological processes of interest. Spatial data products describing dynamic aspects floodplain inundation are, however, not widely available. This study used Landsat imagery to generate multiple observations of inundation extent under varying hydrologic conditions to estimate inundation frequency. Inundation extent was estimated for 50 Landsat scenes and 1334 total images within the Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GCPO LCC), a conservation science partnership working in a 730,000 km2 region in the south central United States. These data were composited into a landscape mosaic to depict relative inundation frequency over the entire GCPO LCC. An analytical methodology is presented for linking the observed inundation extent and frequency with long-term gage measurements so that the outcomes may be useful in defining meaningful critical thresholds for a variety of floodplain dependent organisms as well as important ecological processes.","Yvonne Allen* (Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks Landscape Conservation Cooperative and USFWS – Baton Rouge, LA)",Southeast Aquatic Resources Conservation Science and Practice,,https://gcpolcc.databasin.org/datasets/0d0c5fb9d42f45d3a0a23872eda23543,https://mmancusa.webex.com/mmancusa/ldr.php?RCID=b4555d0fff252dd4310e76c229b8b804,confluence-of-wabash-and-ohio-rivers.jpg,"Yvonne Allen, GCPO LCC and USFWS",Spring (Dec-Mar) inundation frequency at the confluence of the Wabash and Ohio Rivers dervied from Landsat data.

2017-02-15,10:00am ET,"Where’s the grass? Disappearing Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and Declining Water Quality in Lake Mattamuskeet
","Lake Mattamuskeet is a lake located on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula on the eastern coast of North Carolina (Figure 1). The 40,000-acre Lake Mattamuskeet is the centerpiece of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), which provides habitat for wintering waterfowl and other migratory birds. Protecting and enhancing healthy wetland and aquatic ecosystems on the refuge, with a focus on the ecological integrity of Lake Mattamuskeet, is a top priority for the USFWS. USFWS and its partners have become increasingly concerned with the declines occurring in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the lake.  Researchers and refuge staff have noted the changes in SAV over time and as result, a partnership between USFWS, USGS, NC DWR, and NC WRC was formed in 2012 so that a water-quality monitoring program could be implemented.  While water quality could be managed based on historic conditions or the life requisites of particular fish and wildlife species, it has been decided that organizing monitoring and research around the conservation of the lake’s SAV as an overall indicator of the health of the lake ecosystem would be the best way to implement strategic habitat conservation at Lake Mattamuskeet.  Using SAV coverage as our endpoint, future research and monitoring needs are aimed at identifying potential strategies that may reduce HAB and cyanotoxin production in Lake Mattamuskeet and promote SAV growth in the Lake.  These strategies include, but are not limited to implementation of water control structures on surrounding lands, timing hydrologic releases from impoundments and the lake, nutrient abatement strategies with local farmers, carp removal in the lake, and large-scale projects aimed at changing lake level management at Lake Mattamuskeet.

2017-03-15,10:00am ET,Using full life cycle habitat requirements of sturgeon and mussels to develop and apply metrics for assessing flow changes in a regulated river,"Working rivers with multiple uses such as flood risk management, water supply storage, hydroelectric power, and navigation are also important habitat for federally listed and at risk species. The section 7 consultation process requires that the Service assess the effects of river management on federally listed species. Starting with insights about habitat requirements and possible changes in these habitats at each phase of the life cycle for three freshwater mussel species and Gulf sturgeon, we developed a set of metrics to help model changes due to a proposed river management strategy for a series of 5 lock and dams managed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin (ACF) in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Mussel metrics described parameters such as floodplain inundation use by host fishes for spawning, low flow durations, and ramping rates. Sturgeon metrics described parameters such as floodplain inundation for invertebrate food production, estuary salinity, and spawning site depth. We calculated metrics based on daily flow outputs from two hydrologic models of the river basin, ResSim and STELLA, for a 74-year period (1939-2012). We also analyzed 15-minute gage data to calculate effects of peak hydropower production. The proposed management of increasing upstream water storage decreased floodplain inundation that negatively affected both mussel host fish production for fat threeridge and Chipola slabshell as well as food production for Gulf sturgeon. Increasing upstream water storage also increased the time spent at low flows and negatively affected mussel populations. The proposed management also had negative effects by increased the conditions appropriate for hydropeaking during the Gulf sturgeon spawning season. However, the proposed management of releasing more water in the winter to sustain navigation benefited Gulf sturgeon by decreasing estuarine salinity and providing more access for foraging juveniles. Incorporating the habitat needs of all phases of a species life cycle was beneficial in assessing proposed management actions. Data requirements to adequately assess each phase of the life cycle presented a challenge during the consultation, but the full life cycle assessment helped to identify gaps and uncertainties to be addressed through monitoring and adaptive management.

2017-03-29,10:00am ET,How a long-term collaborative effort with multiple partners helped restore and protect the integrity of a bottomland hardwood system on a dam regulated river,"Flows on the lower Roanoke River in North Carolina and Virginia are regulated by the John H. Kerr Dam, and two lower hydropower dams, Gaston and Roanoke Rapids, which are operated by Dominion Generation.  Outflows from Kerr are seasonally low in dissolved oxygen, and discharges were constrained to 20,000 cfs for the benefit of power generation.  This resulted in prolonged aseasonal flooding both in Kerr Reservoir, impacting recreational facilities and roads, and downstream, where conservation lands including Roanoke River NWR have in some years been flooded well into the growing season, negatively affecting bottomland ecosystems.  Anadromous fish spawning habitats and floodplain flora and fauna are adversely impacted, bankside erosion is accelerated, and hunting and fishing activities are often impaired.  The USFWS, The Nature Conservancy, and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission all have extensive conservation land-holdings in the lower Roanoke River floodplain downstream of the dams.  Multiple partners engaged in a multi-year effort, working through a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 216 Study, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relicensing of the hydropower dams, to address all of these issues, using a science-based approach.  Extensive hydrological modeling, geomorphology, floodplain biological studies and negotiations during the two federal processes ultimately resulted in the adoption of a quasi-run-of-river flow regime for the lower river, which all stakeholders eventually supported and which should effectively address the ecological and human impacts of concern.  The value of frequent stakeholder meetings and long-term persistence in yielding a positive outcome cannot be overstated.","Jean Richter* (USFWS – Roanoke River NWR, NC), John Ellis*, Wilson Laney* (USFWS – Raleigh, NC)",Southeast Aquatic Resources Conservation Science and Practice,,,https://mmancusa.webex.com/mmancusa/ldr.php?RCID=c9300f4decb5a25cc26d3c45d329fb32,roanoke-river-nwr-blh.jpg,"Jean Richter, USFWS","The recent adoption of a quasi-run-of-river flow regime at the John H.

2017-01-25,10:00am ET,The Southeast Aquatic Conservation Strategy,"The Southeastern Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation Strategy is a joint project of the UGA River Basin Center and the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute to prioritize watersheds within the region to support future conservation investments. We used museum records, state databases, and online repositories of field collection records to assemble a dataset of almost 1,050 species of fishes, mussels, and stream-associated crayfishes and the locations where they are found, the first entirely data-driven attempt to map these three taxa on a consistent footing across this broad geography. We aggregated these collection points into 290 watersheds (HUC-8 sub-basins), then calculated species richness, imperilment, and endemism scores for each. Working with an advisory team of fourteen respected federal, state, and university biologists, we combined these scores to derive a single overall prioritization for watersheds in the Southeast. While State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs) that incorporate detailed surveys of population status and trajectory must continue to guide conservation decisions within individual states, our regional analysis indicates that the highest priority areas are in the Alabama River basin, particularly the Coosa system, and the Tennessee River basin, particularly the Middle-Tennessee.","Duncan Elkins* (University of Georgia River Basin Center), Sarah Sweat (Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute), Katie Hill (UGA RBC), Bernie Kuhajda (TNACI), Anna George (TNACI), and Seth Wenger (UGA RBC)",Southeast Aquatic Resources Conservation Science and Practice,,http://www.southeastfreshwater.org,https://mmancusa.webex.com/mmancusa/ldr.php?RCID=63980ce43923d1c340eb1ce8c5eca292,priority-290.jpg,"Duncan Elkins, Univ. of Georgia",SE aquatic prioritization ranking by watershed (HUC8),2017-01-25-Elkins-The-SE-aquatic-biodiversity-conservation-strategy.pdf,,
