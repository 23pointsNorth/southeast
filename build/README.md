# Build Scripts

This directory contains all of the different scripts that run throughout the build and development cycles.  Any messages generated by these scripts will appear in your terminal window.

## create-dist.js

This scripts checks that all of the necessary directories in the final `dist` folder are present. If any of the required directories are absent they are automatically created using [mkdirp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp) to avoid errors related to writing files to non-existent directories.

## hero.js

This script takes all of the images from `src/images/hero`, resizes them to the same width using [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) and optimizes them with [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin).  All files are written to `site/static/images/hero/` keeping the same filename as the original source photo.  This script also includes a watcher; when an image is added, changed, or removed from `src/images/hero/`, it will automatically be resized, and optimized, or removed from the output directory.  The watcher is enabled by default.  To disable the watcher, during a production build for example, set the `PRODUCTION` environment variable:

```
PRODUCTION=true npm run hero
```

## hugo.js

This script clears everything out of the `dist` folder before it creates a subprocess that runs the [`Hugo` command](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo/).  This script takes a single parameter, `baseURL`, which allows us to create different builds for `development`, `staging`, and `production` environments.

## images.js

This script looks for folders in the `src/images/pages` directory.  The scripts infers the intended output width of each image based on the name of the containing directory.  For example, any images in `src/images/pages/400` will be resized to 400px wide using [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) and copied to `site/static/images/pages/` with the original file name from the source directory.  If you need an image to be a different size you can create a new directory in `src/images/pages` with a number representing the desired output width.  This script includes a watcher by default.  Any image added, changed, or removed will be processed (or removed) automatically.  To disable the watcher during a production build set the `PRODUCTION` environment variable:

```
PRODUCTION=true npm run images
```

## last-mod.js

This script watches Markdown files in the `site/content` directory (and subdirectories) for changes and automatically injects the current date into the page's [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/).  This date is then used by website templates to display a **Last Updated** date in the site footer.

**We're currently working on a solution for injecting last updated dates into the homepage and other complicated HTML based pages like Mega Map.**

## minify-json.js

This script watches the `src/data` directory for changes and automatically minifies each of the `*.json` files and copies the output to `site/static/data`.  The output uses the same filename as the input except that the extension is changed from `.json` to `.js`.  This change is necessary due to issues with the web server that prevent the use of downloading `.json` files with AJAX.
