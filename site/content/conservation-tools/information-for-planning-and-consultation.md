[IPaC](https://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/) is a project planning tool which streamlines the environmental review process by providing information on the location of listed species and other USFWS trust resources which could potentially be affected by a project.

## Initial project scoping

IPaC can assist in identifying threatened or endangered species, critical habitat, migratory birds, or other natural resources that may be impacted by a project, based on a project area as defined by the user.

## Resource maps

Users can explore the distribution of important biological resources, such as wetlands, National Wildlife Refuges, critical habitat, GAP land cover, and more.

## Official species lists

Users can request an official Species List for their project through IPaC; the list is automatically generated and logged into TAILS and a notification is sent to the appropriate Field Office.

## Impact analysis

Users can provide information about a project and receive a list of conservation measures suggested by the USFWS. This information can be used if you need to start a formal consultation.

## Assisted determination keys

IPaC recently added in the ability to determine if a project qualifies for a programmatic consultation.  By answering simple questions about the proposed project, a user can determine if a project is covered by a programmatic consultation and generate a consistency letter (non-Federal user), or a concurrence verification letter (Federal Agency).  Concurrence letters are logged directly into TAILS and notification is sent to the appropriate Field Office.
