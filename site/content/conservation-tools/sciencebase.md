[ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/) by the U.S. Geological Survey is an open source platform that supports sharing of scientific data, publications, and project tracking. The site allows groups to group related documents and data into a [community](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/what-community), which supports custom branding for a shared digital workspace.  ScienceBase also supports the creation of [geospatial services](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/sciencebase-geospatial-services), which makes sharing data easier and can support web applications.

Sciencebase has a central search and discovery application which makes finding data and projects very easy.  The data is also made available in machine-readable formats through [web services](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/sciencebase-web-services), which allows developers to pull information from ScienceBase into their own applications.  As an example the southeast region science committee pulls project data from ScienceBase into a [list](/science/science-support-partnership/) and a [map](/science/science-support-partnership/project-map).
