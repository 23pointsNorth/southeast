The Service Catalog (ServCat) is a digital library of secure, archived biological information (reports, surveys, databases, geospatial data and images) stored in a centralized, web-based database.  The [2010 Strategic Plan for Inventories and Monitoring on National Wildlife Refuges](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/5527) highlights the importance of collecting and archiving legacy datasets for biological planning and conservation design.

A secondary objective of ServCat is to meet the Department's Open Data Policy based on an [Executive Order](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-). Southeast region refuge managers will set document sensitivity levels (public or internal) in order to determine which records will be made available to the public. Documents made available to the public will be harvested by the government wide [data.gov](https://data.gov).

For more information about ServCat, please contact the Inventory and Monitoring branch chief, [Janet Ertel](mailto:janet_ertel@fws.gov?subject=ServCat), or download the [ServCat fact sheet](/pdf/fact-sheet/service-catalog.pdf).
