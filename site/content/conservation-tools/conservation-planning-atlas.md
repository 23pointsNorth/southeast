A Conservation Planning Atlas (CPA) is a science-based mapping platform where conservation managers and LCC members, and private citizens can go to view, retrieve, and perform analyses on spatial information with specific conservation goals in mind. Users can also upload their own datasets to the CPA.  Eight portals have been created for the LCC network across the Southeast:

 - [Appalachian LCC](https://applcc.databasin.org)
 - [Caribbean LCC](https://caribbeanlcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Gulf Coast Prairie LCC (GCP LCC)](https://gcplcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC (GCPO LCC)](https://gcpolcc.databasin.org/)
 - [North Atlantic LCC (NA LCC)](https://nalcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Peninsular Florida LCC (PA LCC)](https://pflcc.databasin.org/)
 - [South Atlantic LCC (SA LCC)](http://salcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Southeastern United States](http://seregion.databasin.org/)

Data from Landscape Conservation Cooperatives across the Southeast have been integrated into the [Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS) Blueprint](http://secassoutheast.org/blueprint).
