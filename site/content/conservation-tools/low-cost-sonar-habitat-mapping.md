Low-cost sonar habitat mapping is a method developed by Adam Kaeser (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) and Thom Litts (Georgia Department of Natural Resources) for producing high resolution maps of physical habitat features in navigable systems using inexpensive, off-the-shelf sonar and GPS equipment. Associated tools and techniques enable the generation of rectified image mosaics from sonar image snapshots obtained with the Humminbird® Side Imaging system. Physical habitat elements are manually digitized via interpretation of sonar imagery within a GIS. Sonar habitat mapping can be used to quantify the distribution and extent of habitat, investigate terrestrial-aquatic linkages, study patterns of habitat use by resident organisms, and monitor change over time. By providing a unique, rapid, and flexible means to visualize and characterize the underwater environment at the landscape scale, this method can be used to fill critical information gaps in a wide variety of aquatic systems.

We offer comprehensive, not-for-profit instructional workshops on this method, however training documents and supporting literature are freely provided here to anyone interested in this pursuit. We encourage you to peruse these materials and emphasize the Illustrated Guide to Low-Cost Sonar Habitat Mapping and the Sonar Imagery Geoprocessing Workbook as sources for details on the overall method. The content of this webpage and the materials provided are subject to regular update and revision.

## Tools and training

### An illustrated guide to low-cost side-scan sonar habitat mapping

[This 300+ page guidebook](/pdf/workbook/an-illustrated-guide-to-low-cost-sonar-habitat-mapping-v1.0.pdf) represents the fully annotated version of a full-day workshop providing the foundational training for low-cost sonar habitat mapping. Topics covered include side scan sonar basics, image interpretation, mission planning and execution, sonar image geoprocessing, habitat mapping, and map accuracy assessment.

### Side-scan sonar image geoprocessing workbook

[This workbook](/pdf/workbook/sonar-imagery-geoprocessing-workbook-v2.1.pdf) represents an illustrated, step-by-step guide to the processing of raw sonar imagery obtained using the Humminbird® Side Imaging system using custom tools developed by Thom Litts. This technical workbook is meant to accompany the “Illustrated Guide to Low-Cost, Side Scan Sonar Habitat Mapping” and relates specifically to the section on Geoprocessing. The workbook covers in detail all of the processing steps required to transform raw imagery into sonar image maps- seamless raster layers that overlay the surveyed area in a GIS. The [sonar demo dataset](/pdf/workbook/sonar-demo-dataset.zip) accompanies this workbook; it is provided for practical demonstration and training purposes.

### Sonar demo dataset

[This dataset](/pdf/workbook/sonar-demo-dataset.zip) is used during the practical demonstration of image geoprocessing as described in the Sonar Imagery Geoprocessing Workbook. Raw sonar survey data is provided within this directory, in addition to ArcGIS projects (9.x and 10.0 levels) that contain the embedded, custom tools developed exclusively for Humminbird® sonar image geoprocessing.
