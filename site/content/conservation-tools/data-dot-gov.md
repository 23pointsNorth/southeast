[Data.gov](https://data.gov) is the home of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s open data where you will find tools and resources to conduct research, develop web and mobile applications, design data visualizations, and more.  Several Service data management systems including [the Service Catalog](/conservation-tools/service-catalog) are designed to automatically publish publicly available datasets to data.gov including conservation plans, geospatial datasets, and more.

A [2013 Executive Order](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) made open and machine readable the new default for government information.  The Order states

> Openness in government strengthens our democracy, promotes the delivery of efficient and effective services to the public, and contributes to economic growth. As one vital benefit of open government, making information resources easy to find, accessible, and usable can fuel entrepreneurship, innovation, and scientific discovery that improves Americans' lives and contributes significantly to job creation.
