[Planning and Review of Inventory &amp; Monitoring on Refuges (PRIMR)](https://ecos.fws.gov/primr/)

Inventory &amp; Monitoring Policy directs each refuge to produce a standardized inventory and monitoring plan. The [Planning and Review of Inventory &amp; Monitoring on Refuges (PRIMR)](https://ecos.fws.gov/josso/signon/login.do?josso_back_to=https://ecos.fws.gov/primr/josso_security_check&josso_partnerapp_id=primr) database is an **internal tool** that was developed to streamline the process of developing these plans. PRIMR can be used by regional and national I&amp;M staff to identify common survey activities occurring across the National Wildlife Refuge System. The database is beneficial to field stations that want to link their inventory and monitoring activities to specific refuge goals and objectives.
