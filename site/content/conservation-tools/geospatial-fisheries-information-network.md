The [GeoFIN](http://ecos.fws.gov/geofin/) mapper is an interactive mapping tool that allows you to view barriers to fish passage across the U.S. as well as model their removal in your watershed. It also generates profiles and reports for a given geographic area and can search the USFWS fish passage barrier database.
