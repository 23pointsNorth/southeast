The field station was established in 1972. We strive for ecosystem sustainability through preservation, conservation, enhancement, and restoration of habitats essential for the long-term viability of the fish, wildlife, and plants in Louisiana. The field office emphasizes an ecosystem approach incorporating Strategic Habitat Conservation to address and prioritize habitat issues through partnerships with other federal and state agencies, conservation organizations, private landowners, and citizens to achieve the greatest possible benefits to fish and wildlife.

## Relocation

## Threatened and Endangered Species

## Louisiana Endangered Species Act (ESA) project review and guidance for other federal trust resources

[The application](/lafayette/project-review/) is designed to streamline the review of projects for potential effects to federally listed threatened and endangered species (T&amp;E) and their critical habitat (CH).

### Emergency Consultations

Occasionally, federal agencies must respond to emergency situations where human life and property are in danger. Examples include oil spills, wildland fire and hurricanes. The Endangered Species Act and its implementing regulations recognize the need to respond immediately to emergencies and provide special procedures that allow federal agencies the latitude to complete their emergency responses in order to secure human life and property without delay, while still providing them with protections that normal compliance under the ESA would have afforded them.

## Suggested Streamlined Coordination for Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Drilling and Production in Louisiana Shale Plays

[This document](/pdf/guidelines/suggested-streamlined-coordination-oil-and-gas-exploration-drilling-production.pdf) was prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceâ€™s (Service) Louisiana Ecological Services Office (LESO) and partners to protect and conserve important public resources such as wildlife and plants, and their habitats (including waterbodies) within areas of Louisiana with a high potential for new or continued oil and natural gas drilling and production.

## Five Year Strategic Plan

Our Five-Year Strategic Plan details the strategies needed to achieve our goals. An annual review of each program's accomplishments will be completed under the direction of the project leader with each program coordinator. In that review, field office priority areas, partnership opportunities, program focus, personnel development opportunities will be evaluated.
