[Information for Planning and Consultation](https://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/) (IPaC) is a project planning tool which streamlines the USFWS environmental review process. You will be able to determine whether any threatened or endangered species or their critical habitats may exist within your project area and if your proposed action may affect (potential for negative impacts to federally listed species or critical habitat, if applicable) them. If your completed T&E review indicates a "no effect" (no positive or negative impacts to federally listed species or critical habitat, if applicable) to listed species, print this report for your files. Do not send it to the Louisiana Ecological Services Office. If however, your review indicates coordination with the Louisiana Ecological Services Office is recommended, you will be provided additional guidance.

[The IPaC application](https://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/) will also provide you with Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act guidance.
