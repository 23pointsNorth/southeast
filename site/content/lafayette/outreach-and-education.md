The Louisiana field office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offers  information and programs to the public concerning threatened and endangered species, biodiversity, and wildlife ecology, as well as other natural resource-oriented issues in Louisiana. We provide  educational and interpretational programs to a wide variety of audiences including public and private schools, scouts, conservation groups, and more. We believe education is the key to conserving our natural resources for future generations to enjoy.
