The Louisiana Field Office utilizes the latest GIS applications to provide spatial analyses to all programs; Civil Works, Coastal Restoration & Protection, Conservation Planning Assistance, Endangered Species, Environmental Contaminants, and Partners for Fish & Wildlife. These tools provide the capability to look at landscape conservation and ecosystem management; assess habitat suitability, wildlife habitat management, and where to best put limited resources towards protection and recovery.

We also provide GIS and GPS (global positioning system) support to national wildlife refuges  for management plans, oil and gas exploration, elevation and geodetic benchmark surveys, remote sensing and habitat mapping.
