## Conserving habitat for fish and wildlife in Louisiana

To protect the overall public interest, including the environment and our trust resources, Congress has mandated that certain public and private development activities require formal authorization and approval by the Federal Government or state agencies with delegated regulatory authority.
 
Some of these development projects include:

  - Hydropower and alternate energy development
  - Highway construction and re-routing
  - Pipeline construction
  - Gravel mining
  - Cell tower construction
  - Construction or development in wetland habitats
  - Coastal development
 
The goal of the Louisiana Ecological Services Office‘s Conservation Planning Assistance Program work is to provide state-wide project evaluation and consultation for all of the Service’s trust resources. As such, we address potential impacts to threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, interjurisdictional fish, federal lands, protected coastal barriers, conservation areas, and areas that have potential contamination issues. 

We actively participate in the Corps of Engineers’ Wetland Mitigation Bank Review Teams, providing technical assistance to potential bank sponsors regarding wetland habitat restoration and management.  That work has resulted in the conservation and enhancement/restoration of over 85,000 wetland acres.

## Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA)

In the early 1980s, Congress recognized that certain actions and programs of the Federal Government have historically subsidized and encouraged development on [coastal barriers](https://www.fws.gov/CBRA/Coastal-Barriers.html), resulting in the loss of natural resources; threats to human life, health, and property; and the expenditure of millions of tax dollars each year.  To remove the federal incentive to develop these areas, the [Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA)](https://www.fws.gov/CBRA/Legislation.html) of 1982 and subsequent amendments designated relatively undeveloped coastal barriers along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico coasts as part of the [John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS)](https://www.fws.gov/CBRA/Act.html#CBRS), and made these areas ineligible for most new federal expenditures and financial assistance. CBRA encourages the conservation of hurricane prone, biologically rich coastal barriers by restricting federal expenditures that encourage development, such as federal flood insurance. Areas within the CBRS can be developed provided that private developers or other non-federal parties bear the full cost.

To evaluate your project for consistency with CBRA regulations please use our [CBRA Consultation Flowchart](https://www.fws.gov/cbra/documents/CBRA_Consultation_Flowchart_2018_02_01.pdf).  [Learn more about the CBRA consultation process](https://www.fws.gov/cbra/Consultations.html) (e.g., the CBRA consultation template, our interactive mapper, and federal regulations referencing the CBRS).
