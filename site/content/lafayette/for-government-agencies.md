## Civil Works

The [Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act](https://www.fws.gov/habitatconservation/fwca.html) requires federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on all projects that impact wetlands, bayous, coulees, streams, lakes and rivers,  and to give fish and wildlife resources equal consideration during the project planning process, while at the same time accomplishing the objectives of the proposed action.

We work to conserve fish, wildlife and their habitats by minimizing impacts and recommending mitigation for [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)](http://www.usace.army.mil/) flood risk reduction and navigation projects. We improve the design and function of the Corps' ecosystem restoration projects and provide recommendations for beneficial use of dredge material from federally authorized navigation projects. Our staff assists the Corps by serving as members of planning teams, reviewing and providing recommendations on proposed project plans and designs, developing mitigation plans, and providing knowledge and expertise about wildlife and habitat management and wetland restoration.

Other authorities under which we  provide assistance and guidance to help achieve environmental compliance include the [National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)](https://www.fws.gov/habitatconservation/nepa.html), the [Clean Water Act (CWA)](https://www.fws.gov/habitatconservation/cwa.html), the [Migratory Bird Treaty Act](https://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/), the [Endangered Species Act](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/endangered-species-act/), and the [Coastal Barrier Resources Act](https://www.fws.gov/CBRA/).

Our office works with the three Corps' Districts that cover Louisiana: [New Orleans District](http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/), [Vicksburg District](http://www.mvk.usace.army.mil/), and [Galveston District](http://www.swg.usace.army.mil/). The first two districts are in the Corps [Mississippi Valley Division](http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/), while the Galveston District is located in the Corps [Southwestern Division](http://www.swd.usace.army.mil/). Flood risk reduction and navigation were once the principal types of projects, however, ecosystem restoration, primarily coastal wetland restoration associated with the [Louisiana Coastal Area Study (LCA)](http://www.lca.gov/), has increased in importance.
