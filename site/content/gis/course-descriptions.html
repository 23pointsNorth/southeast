Survey123, from ESRI, is a simple and intuitive form-centric data gathering solution that makes creating, sharing, and analyzing surveys possible.  Survey123 allows users to create custom field data entry forms via a web browser or standalone program, and use those forms to capture data in the field on - or offline.  The data collected is all stored in a single location regardless of how many different people are entering data.  The collected data is then available immediately in ArcGIS.
