    <h2>Keynote: Implementing UAS-based LiDAR for High-Resolution Data Capture</h2>
    <p class="instructors">Andy Carroll, Skytec, LLC</p>
    <p class="description">Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are commonly used to capture of high resolution 3D point clouds, surfaces and terrain models. LiDAR sensors are fully capable of vegetation and ground cover penetration for accurate terrain surface measurement, as compared to more common, less obstruction tolerant, photogrammetric methods. Recent advances for inertial measurement unit devices, global navigation satellite system receivers, and regulatory authorizations have increased the deployment of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) for geospatial data acquisition. Comparably, commercially manufactured LiDAR sensor payloads are available in smaller form factors and weights. Results from recent field mapping missions and LiDAR sensor evaluations, indicate increased mobility, reduction of safety hazards, and high data quality results from LiDAR enabled UAS platforms. In addition, UAS systems offer potential time and cost savings, verses traditional survey or manned aircraft acquisitions.</p>
    <p class="description">Mr. Andy Carroll is Co-Founder and CTO of Skytec LLC, an aerial data service provider, based in Chattanooga, TN. Andy has over 18 years of professional experience in environmental and natural resource applications of GIS and remote sensing. Andy has a Masterâ€™s of Science Degree in Environmental Science from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He is a registered Professional Geologist and GISP. Andy has managed multiple state and federally funded applied GIS and remote sensing research projects through his role as Director and principal investigator for the Interdisciplinary Geospatial Technology Lab at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Andy previously served as project manager for the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Division of Superfund, where his work focused on geospatial application development for CERCLIS site management. Andy and his business partner, formed Skytec in March of 2015.</p>

This course will focus on understanding geodatabase structure, feature classes and domains by using them to build and publish a working feature service.  You should leave with the knowledge to build a working feature service that can collect field data using Mobile technology such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
    <p class='description'>Do you or someone you know collect data in the field? Do you have a smartphone or tablet? Would you like a simple way to create custom forms that can be shared and have the data all collected in a single location? Then Survey123 might be the answer!</p>
    <p class='description'>Survey123, from ESRI, is a simple and intuitive form-centric data gathering solution that makes creating, sharing, and analyzing surveys possible. Survey123 allows users to create custom field data entry forms via a web browser or standalone program, and use those forms to capture data in the field on- or offline. The data collected is all stored in a single location regardless how many different people are entering data. The collected data is then available immediately in ArcGIS.</p>
