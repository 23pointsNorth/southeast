## Alabama Marine Mammal Conservation and Recovery Program

### Amount of Funding: $1,281,600

### Year Awarded: 2014

### Funding Organization: National Fish and Wildlife Foundation  

### Grantee: Dauphin Island Sea Lab  

### Project Partners:

  - Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources
  - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
  - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

### Location: Coastal Alabama

### Project Overview

This project seeks to increase the response and research capacity within the Alabama Marine Mammal Stranding Network (ALMMSN). The ALMMSN will work to enhance survival of live stranded animals and provide continuous, consistent and scientifically rigorous data collection from stranded marine mammals to better and more rapidly define causes of death, and define relationships between environmental variables and stranding patterns, thereby contributing to their long-term recovery. Funding will be used to operate the ALMMSN and train dedicated personnel for future stranding response and research on marine mammals. In addition to the Service being a formal partner on the project, Service staff members also volunteer to assist with strandings, necropsies, and manatee captures and tagging.

## Coastal Habitat Restoration Planning Initiative

### Amount of Funding: $2,839,900
### Year Awarded: 2014
### Funding Organization: National Fish and Wildlife Foundation
### Grantee: Mobile Bay National Estuary Program/Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium
### Project Partners:

  - Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources
  - Alabama Department of Environmental Management
  - Geological Survey of Alabama
  - Mobile County
  - Baldwin County

### Location: Mobile Bay and surrounding watersheds

### Project Overview:
This project will develop comprehensive plans to identify the highest priority restoration and conservation needs within the tidally influenced watersheds that directly feed into Mobile Bay. Building on the significant work already undertaken by the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program, this project will acquire high resolution mapping of
the diverse habitats in Alabamaâ€™s two coastal counties to identify the conditions of streams, rivers, riparian buffers, wetlands, intertidal marshes and submerged aquatic vegetation of Mobile Bay and the nearshore Gulf and Mississippi Sound waters. Concurrent to data collection, watershed plans for seven of the state's tidally influenced watersheds will be created. The Service is the co-lead on the Project Implementation Committee, and Service staff regularly provides input in scientific committee meetings, as well as many sidebar meetings, to help mold this initiative.
