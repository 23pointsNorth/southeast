Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs), 22 in total, were established in 2010 as a network of public-private partnerships focused on using cutting edge science to ensure the sustainability of our land, water, wildlife and cultural resources.  While the Department of the Interior introduced the concept and has provided significant resources to get LCCs started, a steering committee of private, nonprofit, local, state, federal and tribal organizations is now investing and collaborating in future-focused research and planning.  They aim to assist conservation practitioners, land use planners, wildlife managers, and many others in meeting the challenges of managing complexity and dramatic change.  The Service is an active member and stalwart supporter of the LCC network.

## Science and Strategic Conservation Strategies

LCC partners define science needs and jointly address broad-scale conservation issues (e.g., sea-level rise) in an ecologically-defined geographic area. Partners provide scientific and technical support for conservation at a very large, or landscape, scale by:

 - creating decision support tools;
 - developing predictive wildlife, habitat, and climate models;
 - prioritizing and conducting research to fill critical gaps in ecological understanding;
 - designing wildlife inventory and monitoring programs.

In the face of accelerated climate change and other 21st-century conservation challenges, LCCs play an important role in synthesizing data, convening new partnerships, and providing a landscape context for local and regional decisions that affect people and resources.  LCCs are fundamental to [Strategic Habitat Conservation](https://www.fws.gov/landscape-conservation/), which is how the Service emphasizes more strategic, accountable, and adaptive action driven by science.  

Six LCCs in the Southeast and Caribbean, including all four Gulf Coast LCCs ([Gulf Coast Prairie](http://gulfcoastprairielcc.org/); [Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks](http://gcpolcc.org/); [South Atlantic](http://southatlanticlcc.org/); and [Peninsular Florida](http://peninsularfloridalcc.org/)), are collaborating on an unprecedented scale to create a [Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy](http://secassoutheast.org/) (SECAS).  A  SECAS “Conservation Blueprint” that stitches together the conservation and restoration priorities of Southeast LCC partners into one unifying map will provide a regional context for a wide variety of local decisions, highlighting common ground for conservation.

## Transformational Science for a Changing Gulf Landscape

Sea level rise, climate extremes, altered river flows, and urbanization are already changing coastal landscapes of the Gulf region and will continue to do so. Determining the best options for managing these impacts to a wide variety of species and habitats across a broad region requires a systematic approach. Accordingly, the four LCCs whose geographic regions cover the Gulf Coast partnered with the [Gulf of Mexico Alliance](http://www.gulfofmexicoalliance.org/) to conduct a [Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment](https://lccnetwork.org/news/gulf-coast-vulnerability-assessment-team-receives-inaugural-sam-d-hamilton-award).

This qualitative assessment focused on determining which ecosystems and species are most vulnerable in the region, where they are most vulnerable, and why.  The results highlighted the threat to coastal marshes, which also provide coastal communities and energy infrastructure a protective bulwark against storm damage. The GCVA is now being used to guide future conservation and restoration efforts by helping natural resource managers, scientists, regional planners, and others to identify vulnerable areas where they can focus critical resources to achieve the most effective outcomes.
