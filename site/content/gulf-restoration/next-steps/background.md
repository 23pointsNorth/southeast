When the _Deepwater Horizon_ oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20, 2010, the Service’s response was robust and included taking on myriad responsibilities, such as working on incident command, wildlife reconnaissance and recovery, sensitive habitat and endangered species protection, finance and other administrative tasks, safety and more. But the Service has been active in the Gulf watershed for years; we see ourselves as one of the many stakeholders in Gulf restoration, and we are thoroughly engaged within the communities and landscapes of the Gulf. For example, the Service has been managing millions of acres on 235 national wildlife refuges (NWRs) in the Gulf watershed, with the 47 located in the Gulf Coast states covering more than 2.15 million acres of managed lands alone. In fact, the first NWR established anywhere was located in the Gulf states with the establishment of Pelican Island NWR in Vero Beach, Florida, in 1903\. The first such refuge on the Gulf Coast itself followed soon afterwards with the establishment of Breton Island Reservation (now Breton NWR) to protect important bird-nesting islands located off the coast of Louisiana. Additionally, the Service has field and regional representation in all 31 states in the Gulf of Mexico watershed. Throughout the watershed, the Service has long provided a combination of planning and on-the-ground contributions to natural resource protection and conservation.

Similarly, signs of serious ecosystem degradation had been documented in the Gulf of Mexico watershed well before the _Deepwater Horizon_ disaster. For decades, countless stressors altered and degraded the Gulf ecosystem. The Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently calculated that the Gulf of Mexico coastal region overall experienced a [net wetland loss](https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Documents/Status-and-Trends-of-Wetlands-in-the-Conterminous-United-States-2004-to-2009.pdf) of 257,150 acres between 2004 and 2009 alone. In fact, the swamps and marshes of coastal Louisiana are among the nation's most fragile. [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) trend analyses](http://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3164/) from 1985 to 2010 show a wetland loss rate that, if it were to occur at a constant rate, would equate to Louisiana losing an area the size of one football field per hour. The degradation of this monumentally important watershed became even worse, however, after the _Deepwater Horizon_ oil spill.

## $1.9 Billion Invested in _Deepwater Horizon_ Oil Spill-Related Gulf Conservation and Restoration Projects (April 2010 - January 2017)

*   $868 million invested in Gulf restoration projects through NRDA
*   $156.6 million invested in Gulf restoration projects through the RESTORE Council
*   $870 million invested in Gulf restoration projects through NFWF
*   $56.5 million invested in Gulf restoration projects (in the United States) through the North American Wetlands Conservation Act Program
*   $20 million invested in Supplemental Environmental Projects focused on land acquisition and habitat protection through a civil settlement with MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC (one of the responsible parties)

Between 2011 and 2016, more than $1.9 billion has been invested in Gulf restoration efforts through money dedicated to that purpose by civil and criminal settlements reached with the parties responsible for the 2010 disaster. The Service’s role in the Gulf has continued through our membership in, and involvement with, the key groups and processes overseeing many of these funds. A prime example of this is the role the Service plays in the _Deepwater Horizon_ Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR). The U.S. Department of the Interior (The Department) is designated as the Lead Administrative Trustee on the [_Deepwater Horizon_ NRDAR Trustee Council](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doi.gov/deepwaterhorizon&sa=D&ust=1477585771712000&usg=AFQjCNEzUfcOkS6y2F_dh9gUnBgOmD0BXg). The Service’s Southeast Regional Director, as the Authorized Official for the Department, represents the trusteeship interests of the Secretary of the Interior in conducting the work of the Trustee Council.

The Trustee Council, which includes representatives of three other federal agencies and five Gulf Coast states, began its work by first assessing the injury to natural resources and the services they provide caused by the oil spill, and then planning and implementing restoration projects based on information gleaned from the injury assessment. The Service led a large part of the injury assessment since 2010 and has invested millions of dollars quantifying injuries to Service trust resources (migratory birds, listed species, etc.). By working with our co-trustees to fully describe these injuries, we are able to plan and implement strategies and projects to restore injured resources to the condition they would have been had the oil spill not occurred. Since 2012, the Service has already led the Trustees’ effort to work with the public to develop and finalize five restoration plans that together include 65 projects designed to restore identified injuries with a combined cost of approximately $868 million to date.

The _Deepwater Horizon_ oil spill injured lands managed by the Service throughout the Gulf (e.g., Bon Secour, St. Vincent, Grand Bay, Delta, Breton, Big Branch Marsh and McFaddin NWRs). The Service seeks to restore federal lands at the locations where injury occurred while considering approaches that provide coastal resiliency and sustainability. If restoration cannot be implemented at these sites, the Service will look to other federally managed lands in the Gulf of Mexico watershed. Through NRDAR, emphasis will be placed on restoring habitat such as wetlands, dunes and beaches, submerged aquatic vegetation and barrier islands located on federal lands.

In late 2012 and early 2013, settlements and other _Deepwater Horizon_-related agreements with parties responsible for the oil spill directed a total of $2.544 billion to the [NFWF](http://www.nfwf.org/gulf/Pages/home.aspx) to fund projects benefiting the natural resources of the Gulf Coast that were impacted. They also directed $500 million to go to the [National Academy of Sciences](http://www.nationalacademies.org/gulf/index.html) to develop a program focused on enhancing oil system safety, human health and environmental resources. The Service serves on the advisory boards for NFWF’s Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund and the science program, as well as provides technical assistance and environmental clearances for projects they fund. The Service also plays an important role with respect to the [NAWCA Program](http://www.fws.gov/birds/grants/north-american-wetland-conservation-act.php), which is to receive $100 million as part of the 2013 settlement with one of the responsible parties, British Petroleum (BP). The Service reviews proposals and recommends projects for the NAWCA Program focused on wetlands restoration and conservation in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and then administers those projects chosen for funding by the North American Wetlands Conservation Council. By the end of 2016, NFWF has invested approximately $862 million, and the NAWCA Program has invested approximately $56.5 million, in projects supporting the restoration of the Gulf watershed.

Another major funding process involving the Department through which the Service plays a key role is the [Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council](https://www.restorethegulf.gov/) (RESTORE Council), a federal entity created by the 2012 Resources and Ecosystem Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act (RESTORE Act). The RESTORE Council oversees a trust fund that will receive 80 percent of the civil and administrative penalties paid to the federal government under the Clean Water Act by all the parties responsible for the _Deepwater Horizon_ oil spill. In 2013, $4.4 billion was directed to this fund through a criminal settlement with one of the responsible parties. The Department’s Secretary is one of six federal members, and the Service’s Southeast Regional Director acts as the Secretary’s representative, on the body. The Service is also one of four Department bureaus that play significant roles in advising the Department on restoration priorities and in working collaboratively with other RESTORE Council members to achieve restoration and conservation goals. To date, the RESTORE Council has invested approximately $156 million in Gulf restoration projects.

Gulf restoration received a significant boost when the presiding judge gave final approval on April 4, 2016, to a global legal settlement with BP, the party primarily responsible for the _Deepwater Horizon_ oil spill. The settlement adds billions of dollars to state and federal efforts over the next two decades to rehabilitate and improve the natural resources of the Gulf region. Given the scope and scale of what is possible with all of this funding support, the Service acknowledges that this is the time to reassess conservation and restoration needs, build upon existing successful efforts to address ongoing needs, and generate fresh ideas and innovative approaches. With Next Steps, the Service is articulating its recommendations for moving forward with Gulf restoration into the future.
