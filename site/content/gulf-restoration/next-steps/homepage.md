The Service mission statement is clear on this point: *Work with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people*. Nowhere is a partnership-driven approach more central in fulfilling this mission than in the Gulf of Mexico watershed.

## Next Steps

The Service released “Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed” in 2016 as a companion document to the Service’s 2013 “Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed.” In the earlier document, the Service articulated overarching restoration and conservation strategies for sustaining fish and wildlife resources and thriving communities in the Gulf of Mexico watershed. “Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed“ is intended to refine and put on paper more specific perspectives, priorities and preferred courses of action held by the Service. It is a representation of our collective understanding and a tool for us and our partners for developing, promoting and securing specific restoration across the watershed.

The Service’s “Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed”:

- reiterates our belief that a long-term, large-scale, watershed-level approach to restoration and conservation is important if we are to achieve a healthy Gulf;
- highlights specific courses of action for the development and implementation of conservation and restoration initiatives in each of the geographic focal areas included in “Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed” as well as in two new focal areas; and
- identifies target species that are federal trust resource species on which the Service is currently concentrating its science and on-the-ground restoration efforts to strategically address conservation and restoration needs.

State and federal agencies and other stakeholders have made major investments in Gulf restoration, especially since the 2010 *Deepwater Horizon* oil spill. Many more investments, however, will be made over the next two decades as more than $20 billion in *Deepwater Horizon*-related settlement funds come available for restoration work. We believe the unprecedented amount of funding and the enormity of the challenge requires a level of collaboration never before seen in an ecosystem restoration effort. “Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed” is intended to take our conversations with our partners and other stakeholders to a deeper and richer level, where specificity allows the recognition of mutual stewardship and goals to increase integration of resources, knowledge, and expertise. Such collaborations by all parties will significantly increase the probability of successful Gulf restoration outcomes that benefit the American people for generations to come.
