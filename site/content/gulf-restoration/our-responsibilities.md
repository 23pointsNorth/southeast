The Service is the primary federal agency responsible for conserving and enhancing the nation's fish and wildlife populations and their habitats. However, the conservation of fish and wildlife is a shared responsibility. The Service works closely with with other federal agencies and state governments, as well as other partners, in order to to conserve, protect and enhance our nation's natural resources.

## Natural resources of the Gulf

### Fish and wildlife

The Service has specific responsibilities as defined by legislation, a treaty or similar authority toward certain natural resources. These resources include migratory birds, certain marine mammals and fish species that move across boundaries of states and nations (“interjurisdictional fish”). The Service is also charged with administering [The Endangered Species Act of 1973](https://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/esact.html) (ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.), which is aimed at helping increase the populations of threatened and endangered species and reducing the threats to their survival. The Gulf watershed is famous for the richness and diversity of its wildlife, and is home to more than 500 federally listed species (of which more than 350 are endangered). These include some of America’s most beloved and iconic species -- from the West Indian manatee, an aquatic relative of the elephant, to the whooping crane, North America’s tallest bird. In addition, the Service is responsible for administering a national network of lands and waters known as the [National Wildlife Refuge System](https://www.fws.gov/refuges/).

## Wildlife refuges

The Service is one of the principal federal agencies responsible for conserving, protecting and enhancing the nation's fish, wildlife and plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. In support of this mission, the Service manages an extensive network of public lands and waters dedicated to wildlife conservation known as the National Wildlife Refuge System. The nation’s first National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was created off Florida’s Atlantic Coast, on Pelican Island. The second refuge, established in 1904, was in the Gulf region &mdash; Breton NWR off the coast of Louisiana.

There are now 235 refuges in the Gulf of Mexico watershed that provide opportunities for people to enjoy America’s great outdoors. Each refuge provides unique opportunities for people to connect with nature. Visitors can take advantage of extensive trails, auto tour routes, boardwalks, observation decks, hunting and photography blinds, fishing piers and boat launches.

You are invited to visit a National Wildlife Refuge near you. There are many to choose from &mdash; just along the Gulf of Mexico, the Service administers 47 National Wildlife Refuges from Brownsville, Texas to the Florida Keys (covering more than 2.15 million managed acres). They include the beautiful estuaries and marshes of [St. Marks NWR](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/st_marks/), with an [historic lighthouse](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/St_Marks/visit/lighthouse_history.html); big river and forested wetlands of [Lower Suwannee NWR](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/lower_suwannee/); iconic [manatees](/wildlife/mammals/manatee) at [Crystal River NWR](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/crystal_river/) in Florida; the beaches and dunes of [Bon Secour NWR](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bon_secour/) in Alabama; coastal marshes and urban interface at [Bayou Sauvage](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bayou_sauvage/) and [Big Branch Marsh](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/big_branch_marsh/) NWRs in Louisiana; coastal prairie and wetlands at [Grand Bay NWR](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/grand_bay/) in Mississippi; and many refuges in Texas such as [Aransas](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/aransas/), [Anahuac](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/anahuac/) and [McFaddin](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/mcfaddin/) NWRs.
