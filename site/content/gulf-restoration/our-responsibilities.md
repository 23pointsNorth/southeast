The Service is the primary federal agency responsible for conserving and enhancing the nation's fish and wildlife populations and their habitats. However, the conservation of fish and wildlife is a shared responsibility. The Service works closely with with other federal agencies and state governments, as well as other partners, in order to to conserve, protect and enhance our nation's natural resources.

The Service has specific “trust resource” responsibilities as defined by legislation, a treaty or similar authority. These trust resources include endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, certain marine mammals, and fish species that move across boundaries of states and nations (“interjurisdictional fish”). In addition, the Service is responsible for administering a national network of lands and waters known as the National Wildlife Refuge System.  This network has grown to include more than 560 refuges, 38 wetland management districts and other protected areas encompassing 150 million acres of land and water from the Caribbean to the remote Pacific. There is at least one national wildlife refuge in every state and territory and within an hour’s drive of most major metropolitan areas.

## Trust Resources of the Gulf

There are 47 National Wildlife Refuges along the Gulf Coast, and more than 500 species in the Gulf of Mexico watershed that are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

An endangered species is one that has been determined to be likely to become extinct throughout all or a large portion of their range; a threatened species is one that is likely to become endangered in the near future.
