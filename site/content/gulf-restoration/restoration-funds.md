From 2011 – 2015, more than $1.5 billion was invested in Gulf restoration efforts through funds dedicated to that purpose by civil and criminal settlements reached with the parties responsible for the 2010 *Deepwater Horizon* oil spill. When the presiding judge gave final approval in April 4, 2016, to a global legal settlement with British Petroleum  (the party primarily responsible for the disaster), Gulf restoration funding received a significant boost. The Service is an active member of, and collaboratively involved gadwall-hen-and-drakeand processes overseeing many of these funds.

Below is additional information and links to third-party resources related to the post-*Deepwater Horizon* Gulf restoration process.

In early 2013, a U.S. District Court approved two plea agreements resolving certain criminal cases against responsible parties of the *Deepwater Horizon* oil spill that direct a total of $2.544 billion to the [National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund](http://www.nfwf.org/gulf/Pages/home.aspx) to fund projects benefiting the natural resources of the Gulf Coast that were impacted.

On January 29, 2013, British Petroleum (BP) pled guilty to 14 criminal counts stemming from its actions related to the *Deepwater Horizon* oil spill, including one misdemeanor count of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Under the plea agreement, BP agreed to pay $100 million to the the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund; these grants are facilitated by the Service through its [Migratory Bird Program North American Conservation Wetlands Act (NAWCA)](http://www.fws.gov/birds/grants/north-american-wetland-conservation-act.php) activities.

The [*Deepwater Horizon* Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA)](http://www.gulfspillrestoration.noaa.gov/) process allows (under the Oil Pollution Act) trustees of affected states and the federal government to determine the levels of harm caused by the oil spill and the appropriate remedies.The types of damages that are recoverable include the cost of replacing or restoring the lost resource, the lost value of those resources if or until they are recovered, and any costs incurred in assessing the harm. Additional information can be found at the [Department of Interior’s *Deepwater Horizon* NRDA website](https://www.doi.gov/deepwaterhorizon/nrda).

[The RESTORE Act](https://www.treasury.gov/services/restore-act/Pages/home.aspx) dedicates 80 percent of all administrative and civil penalties related to the *Deepwater Horizon* spill to a Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and outlines a structure by which the funds can be utilized to restore and protect the natural resources, ecosystems, fisheries, marine and wildlife habitats, beaches, coastal wetlands and economy of the Gulf Coast region. The RESTORE Act allocates funding via five “Buckets,” with two overseen by the [Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council)](https://www.restorethegulf.gov/). The five ways the RESTORE Act funding is allocated is as follows:

- 35 percent equally divided among the five States for ecological restoration, economic development, and tourism promotion (known as “Direct Component funding” or “Bucket One”);
- 30 percent plus interest managed by the RESTORE Council for ecosystem restoration under the Comprehensive Plan (known as “Council funding” or “Bucket Two”);
- 30 percent divided among the States according to a formula to implement State expenditure plans, which require approval of the RESTORE Council (known as “Spill Impact Component funding” or “Bucket Three”);
- 2.5 percent plus interest for the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Science, Observation, Monitoring and Technology Program within the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (known as [“NOAA RESTORE Act Science Program”](http://www.gulfspillrestoration.noaa.gov/) or “Bucket Four”); and
- 2.5 percent plus interest allocated to the States for Centers of Excellence Research grants, which will each focus on science, technology, and monitoring related to Gulf restoration (known as “Gulf States Centers of Excellence funding” or “Bucket Five”).
