The Service’s [Migratory Bird Program](https://www.fws.gov/birds/index.php) monitors and manages a diverse range of birds -- from waterfowl and raptors to shorebirds, grassland birds and songbirds -- to help conserve and protect their habitats and ensure sustainable populations. Program staff are committed to ensuring the health of the Gulf of Mexico watershed, as it contains vitally important migration and wintering habitat for birds. Parts of the Central, Mississippi, and Atlantic flyways (well-described routes between wintering grounds and summer nesting grounds) are used by hundreds of millions of birds that converge on the northern Gulf Coast. Some bird species may then cross the Gulf in their migration, while others  may circumnavigate the body of water.

Thirty-one states drain into the Gulf of Mexico. Two areas within the watershed of particular importance to migratory birds are:

## The Gulf Coast

Birds found along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico include waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species, nearshore and pelagic seabirds, raptors, colonial waterbirds, shorebirds, marshbirds, and passerines. This region is also home to many regionally important bird colonies. For example, the northern Gulf Coast harbors nearly half the southeastern population of brown pelicans and about 75 percent of the population of sandwich terns in the southeastern United States. In addition, the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast support some of the largest colonies of sandwich terns in the world.

## The Prairie Pothole Region

Sweeping across five Midwestern states (and three Canadian provinces), the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is an important habitat and natural resource of the northern Great Plains grasslands. As ancient glaciers retreated more than 10,000 years ago, millions of shallow depressions were left. These depressions (“potholes”) often fill with snowmelt and rainwater in the spring, creating valuable temporary and seasonal wetlands that support diverse plants and invertebrates used as food resources for the myriad migratory birds staging and breeding in the PPR. This area is often referred to as “the duck factory” because it is one of the most productive areas for nesting waterfowl on the continent.

Many species have strong connections to both Gulf Coast and PPR habitats. For example, the remaining intact grasslands and wetlands in the PPR host some of the largest breeding populations of redheads in North America, while approximately 80 percent of the world’s population of redheads migrate to winter in the Laguna Madre area of the Gulf Coast. Other bird species that nest in the PPR that also have a strong connection to the Gulf include piping plover, northern harrier, marbled godwit, least sandpiper, upland sandpiper, Nelson’s (sharp-tailed) sparrow and LeConte’s sparrow.

## Joint Ventures

Among the responsibilities of the Service’s Migratory Bird Program is the coordination of the 18 collaborative, regionally-based partnerships known as [Migratory Bird Joint Ventures](http://mbjv.org/). These partnerships are comprised of federal and state agencies, non-profit organizations, universities, corporations, tribes and individuals working to implement bird conservation plans within specific geographic areas or for certain species or groups of species. The Migratory Bird Joint Ventures that cover parts of the Gulf watershed are:

- [Gulf Coast Joint Venture](http://www.gcjv.org/)
- [East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint Venture](http://www.egcpjv.org/)
- [Prairie Pothole Joint Venture](http://ppjv.org/)
- [Intermountain West Joint Venture](http://iwjv.org/)
- [Rio Grande Joint Venture](http://www.rgjv.org/)
- [Oaks & Prairies Joint Venture](http://opjv.org/)
- [Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture](http://www.lmvjv.org/)
- [East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint Venture](http://www.egcpjv.org/)
- [Atlantic Coast Joint Venture](http://www.acjv.org/)
- [Central Hardwoods Joint Venture](http://www.chjv.org/)
- [Rainwater Basin Joint Venture](http://www.rwbjv.org/)
- [Upper Mississippi/Great Lakes Region Joint Venture](http://www.uppermissgreatlakesjv.org/)
- [Northern Great Plains Joint Venture](http://ngpjv.org/)
- [Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture](http://www.amjv.org/)
- [Playa Lakes Joint Venture](http://www.pljv.org/)

In addition to our work related to migratory birds, the Service also manages the conservation of [bird species that are threatened or endangered in the Gulf of Mexico watershed](/gulf-restoration/our-responsibilities/birds), as well as the habitats upon which they depend.
