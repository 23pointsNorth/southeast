## Island Road Marsh Terracing

### Amount of Funding: $704,000 via North American Wetlands Conservation Act
### Year Awarded: 2014
### Funding Organization: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
### Grantee: Ducks Unlimited, Inc.
### Project Partners:

  - Parish Consolidated Government
  - Louisiana Land & Exploration
  - Lafourche Parish Government
  - United Houma Nation
  - Bayou Grace
  - Restore or Retreat

### Location: Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes
### Project Overview:

This project will beneficially impact a total of 938 acres of intermediate to brackish coastal marsh, benefiting a diverse array of migratory birds and other wildlife in the Gulf Coast Joint Ventureâ€™s Mississippi River Coastal Wetlands Initiative Area. Grant and match funds will pay for costs associated with building 60,000 linear feet of marsh terraces, and for plantings to stabilize the terraces, on 799 acres in Terrebonne Parish adjacent to Pointe-aux-Chenes Wildlife Management Area southeast of Houma. Restoration work to be completed through the project will promote the increased production of desirable plant communities and provide benefits to priority migratory birds.

## Golden Triangle Marsh Creation (Planning)

### Amount of Funding: $4,347,733 via RESTORE Act
### Year Awarded: 2015
### Funding Organization: Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council)
### Grantee: Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority
### Project Partners:

  - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge

### Project Overview:

This project completes the planning activities for the creation of approximately 600 acres of marsh within the Golden Triangle Marsh system. These wetlands provide an important natural buffer in the multiple lines of defense protecting geographically vulnerable communities in New Orleans from storm surge. The marsh will be constructed by hydraulically dredging and pumping sediment from Lake Borgne to a 600-acre fill site located approximately 16 miles from the borrow site. Earthen containment dikes will be constructed to facilitate the creation of the marsh. The project resides partially within the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge boundary (the largest urban wildlife refuge in the United States), and as a result will greatly benefit the fish and wildlife populations that utilize the refuge and enhance recreational opportunities in the area.
