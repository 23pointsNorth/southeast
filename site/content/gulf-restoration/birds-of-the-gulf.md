The Service is responsible, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for implementing provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  This means the Service manages the conservation of bird species that are federally listed as threatened or endangered in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, as well as the conservation of the habitats upon which they depend.

In addition, the Service is the federal agency with primary responsibility for managing a diverse range of migratory birds that aren’t federally listed to help conserve and protect their habitats and ensure sustainable populations. Our authority is based on the [Migratory Bird Treaty Act](https://www.fws.gov/birds/policies-and-regulations/laws-legislations/migratory-bird-treaty-act.php) (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), which implements conventions with Great Britain (for Canada), Mexico, Japan and Russia. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act makes it illegal for anyone to take, possess, import, export, transport, sell, purchase, barter or offer for sale, purchase, or barter, any migratory bird, or the parts, nests, or eggs of such a bird except under the terms of a valid permit issued pursuant to federal regulations. The Service has responsibilities for all migratory bird species that migrates through or breeds, stages or winters in the Gulf watershed.

The Service works closely with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. Bird species of the Gulf watershed for which the Service has legally mandated responsibilities include:

## Piping Plover

[The piping plover (*Charadrius melodus*)](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/pipingplover/pdf/piplfactsheet.pdf) is a small shorebird approximately seven inches long with sand-colored plumage on its back and crown and white underparts. It has three separate populations that breed only in North America: the Atlantic Coast, the Northern Great Plains and the Great Lakes populations. Individuals of all three breeding populations can be found migrating through or overwintering  along the Gulf Coast.   

The Northern Great Plains and Atlantic Coast populations are threatened, and the Great Lakes population is endangered on their breeding grounds. Piping plovers for all three populations are considered threatened throughout their migrating and wintering range.

## Brown Pelican

Photo by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS." >}}

[The brown Pelican (*Pelecanus occidentalis*)](https://www.fws.gov/birds/MBTreaty100/files/Education/brown_pelican.pdf) measures up to 54 inches long, weighs eight to 10 pounds, and has a wingspan between 6.5  and 7.5 feet. As to be expected from its name, a brown pelican can be identified by its blackish brown belly, chestnut-and-white neck, and brown streaked back, rump, and tail.

The brown pelican inhabits the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf Coasts of North and South America. On the Gulf Coast, the species is found in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Mexico. The species was federally listed as endangered in 1970 (under a law that preceded the Endangered Species Act of 1973) because of population declines linked to factors including plume hunting and the effects of the pesticide DDT. Thanks to successful conservation efforts and the banning of DDT, the brown pelican was removed from the federal endangered species list in 2009. While no longer federally listed, the Service is legally mandated to manage the brown pelican population because the agency has the primary responsibility for administration of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (1918), its amendments, and subsequent acts.

## Red-cockaded Woodpecker

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/red-cockaded-woodpecker-feeding-young.jpg" alt="A black and white bird with band on it's leg perched on a tree covered in white sap." caption="Due to a dramatic decline in suitable mature pine forest habitat, the red-cockaded woodpecker was federally listed as endangered in 1970. Photo by John Maxwell, USFWS." link="https://flic.kr/p/9R5DZw" >}}

[The red-cockaded woodpecker (*Picoides borealis*)](http://www.fws.gov/birds/MBTreaty100/files/Education/Red-cockadedwoodpecker.pdf) is approximately seven inches long. Its back is barred with black and white horizontal stripes. The red-cockaded woodpecker's most distinguishing feature is a black cap and nape that encircle large white cheek patches. Rarely visible, except perhaps during the breeding season and periods of territorial defense, the male has a small red streak on each side of its black cap called a cockade, hence its name. The common name came into use during the early 1800’s when “cockade” was regularly used to refer to a ribbon or other ornament worn on a hat.

Red-cockaded woodpeckers once could be found in the southeast from New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia to Florida, west to Texas, and north to portions of Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Red-cockaded woodpeckers live in mature pine forests -- specifically those with longleaf pines averaging 80 to 120 years old and loblolly pines averaging 70 to 100 years old. From the late 1800s to the mid 1900s, red-cockaded woodpecker populations declined rapidly as their mature pine forest habitat was altered for a variety of uses (e.g., timber harvest, agriculture). The red-cockaded woodpecker was federally listed as endangered in 1970.  

## American Green-winged Teal

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/green-winged-teal-male.jpg" alt="A bird swimming on the surface of a waterbody with a bright green spot on it's rust colored head." caption="Since the Service has the primary responsibility for the administration of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, it manages populations of species like the American green-winged teal. Photo by Tom Koerner, USFWS." link="https://flic.kr/p/rxD5fR" >}}

The American green-winged teal (*Anas crecca*) is the smallest North American duck, between 12 and 15 inches long, with a short neck and small bill. The male has a cinnamon-colored head with a gleaming green crescent that extends from the eye to the back of the head. In flight, both sexes flash deep-green wing patches.  

The American green-winged teal migrates from northern North America via all major flyways (Pacific, Central, Mississippi and Atlantic) to reach wintering grounds from coastal British Columbia to as far south as Central America. They are most abundant along the Mississippi and Central flyways, where the coastal marshes and rice fields of Louisiana and Texas provide ideal habitat. The species is not federally listed as threatened or endangered, but the Service has the primary responsibility for administration of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (1918), its amendments, and subsequent acts. Therefore, the Service is legally mandated to manage the American green-winged teal population.

## Whooping Crane

Photo by Kraus Nigge, USFWS." link="https://flic.kr/p/8Nw3HP" >}}

[The whooping crane (*Grus Americana*)](http://www.fws.gov/northflorida/whoopingcrane/whoopingcrane-fact-2001.htm) is found only in North America, and is the continent’s tallest bird, with males approaching 5 feet when standing erect. These cranes are almost entirely white; their most noticeable characteristic is a large red patch on the head that is made of skin and is almost featherless.

In 1941 there were only 21 whooping cranes left: 15 were migrants between Canada and Texas while the rest lived year-round in Louisiana. The Louisiana population went extinct, and all of today’s whooping cranes are descended from the small flock that breeds in Canada and winters in Texas. Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at three locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The bird was listed as federally endangered in 1967.

## Redhead

Photo by Neil Mishler, USFWS." link="https://flic.kr/p/e6XCQX" >}}

The redhead (*Aythya americana*) is a medium-sized diving duck approximately 16 to 21 inches long. During breeding season, adult male redheads have a brick red colored head and neck, with a black breast and gray body. Females and immatures are a plain, mostly uniform brown. All have a black-tipped, blue-gray bill.

Redheads breed primarily in the prairie pothole region of the Midwest. In winter, approximately 80 percent of the world’s population of redheads migrate and form huge flocks in two Gulf bays, the Laguna Madre of Texas and Laguna Madre of Mexico. The species is not federally listed as threatened or endangered, but the Service has the primary responsibility for administration of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (1918), its amendments, and subsequent acts. Therefore, the Service is legally mandated to manage the redhead population.
