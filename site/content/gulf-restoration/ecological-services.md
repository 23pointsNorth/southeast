The Service’s [Ecological Services Program](http://www.fws.gov/ecological-services/) is a leader in conserving our nation's imperiled species and their habitats, ensuring that sustainable populations of fish, wildlife and plants continue to thrive for future generations. There are [offices in all 50 states](https://www.fws.gov/offices/), with eight servicing the Gulf Coast. Ecological Services Program staff handle a varied workload that includes:

 - Meeting our legal obligations. For example, program staff assist the Service in:
  - Administering The [Endangered Species Act of 1973](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/) (ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.), which is aimed at helping increase the populations of threatened and endangered species and reducing the threats to their survival. The Gulf watershed is home to more than 500 federally listed species, of which more than 350 are endangered. They include some of America’s most beloved and iconic species -- from the West Indian manatee, an aquatic relative of the elephant, to the whooping crane, North America’s tallest bird.
  - Administering The [Coastal Barrier Resources Act](https://www.fws.gov/ecological-services/habitat-conservation/coastal.html) (CBRA, Public Law 97-348), which is aimed at encouraging the conservation of hurricane-prone, biologically rich designated areas along the Gulf coast (as well as those along the Atlantic and Great Lakes) by restricting federal expenditures that encourage their development.
 - Working in coordination with state agencies and other partners to develop and implement conservation strategies and actions that preclude federal listing under the Endangered Species Act of at-risk species (i.e.,  species that are either candidates, or have been proposed or petitioned, for listing under the Endangered Species Act). There are more than 300 [at-risk species](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/candidateconservation/finder2/#/species/list) in the Gulf States alone.
 - Developing and maintaining mutually productive and supportive partnerships with the state wildlife agencies and other stakeholders (e.g., federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations, private landowners) to conserve endangered species and wildlife habitats.
 - Assisting in the completion of necessary environmental compliance reviews for Gulf restoration projects. Moreover, our environmental compliance work includes:
  - Providing technical assistance and education to federal and state agencies, and prospective applicants, regarding regulatory issues.
  - Helping federal permitting agencies with regulatory compliance and coordinating environmental compliance reviews across all Gulf restoration funding sources.
  - Developing regulatory review efficiencies to streamline and make environmental compliance reviews consistent.
