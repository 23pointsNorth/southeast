## Texas Gulf Coast XI

 - Private landowners
 - Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
 - Futch Foundation

### Project Overview:

This project will restore and enhance 2,612 acres of wetland and upland habitat, including seasonally flooded rice fields, on public and private lands. The Texas Gulf Coast is one of the most important migration and wintering habitats in North America for populations of waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, Neotropical migratory songbirds and other wetland wildlife. Working with landowners to compensate for the regionâ€™s continued loss of marsh and wet prairies, partners will enhance foraging, water quality, flood storage and soil conservation throughout the project area. The work will benefit 334 bird species including Mottled Duck, Northern Pintail, Mallard, Lesser Scaup, Greater Scaup and Cackling Canada Goose.
