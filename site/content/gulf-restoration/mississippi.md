## Habitat Restoration: Federal Lands Program - Phase I

### Amount of Funding: $9,905,300
### Year Awarded: 2015
### Funding Organization: National Fish and Wildlife Foundation
### Grantee: Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality
### Project Partners:

  - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
  - National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service

### Project Overview:

This project will enhance and restore habitat on federal lands in coastal Mississippi. Anticipated outcomes for key focal habitats include restoration of more than 30,000 acres through invasive species removal, forest thinning and prescribed burning on lands contained within Grand Bay National Wildlife Refuge, Gulf Islands National Seashore and the De Soto National Forest (Tchoutacabouffa River/Tuxachanie Creek watershed). The project also includes control of non-native mammals on Horn, Sand and Petit Bois Islands within the Gulf Islands National Seashore.

## Strategic Land Protection, Conservation and Enhancement of Priority Gulf Coast Landscapes (Planning & Implementation)

### Amount of Funding: $15, 500,000
### Year Awarded: 2015
### Funding Organization: Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council)
### Grantee: Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality
### Project Partners

  - U.S. Department of the Interior
    - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
    - National Park Service
    - U.S. Forest Service
  - U.S. Department of Agriculture

### Project Overview:

This project includes planning, strategy development, environmental compliance, and, where appropriate, acquisition of eligible properties. Priority areas for planning and environmental compliance for potential acquisitions include: Graveline Bay and Pascagoula/Escatawpa River systems (Jackson County); Turkey Creek, Wolf River (Harrison County); and Hancock County Marsh (Hancock County). Initial priority areas chosen for acquisition are Gulf Islands National Seashore; the Grand Bay National Wildlife Refuge complex; and the upper reaches of the Tuxachanie/Tchoutacabouffa River in the De Soto National Forest. Several hundred acres are anticipated to be acquired from willing sellers using two methods: fee simple acquisition and conservation easements. Areas acquired will be placed in conservation for perpetuity; ecological benefits could include water quality and quantity improvements, biodiversity enhancements, increased habitat connectivity and reduced edge effects.
