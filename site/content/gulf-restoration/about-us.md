## Our Role

The Service is uniquely positioned to be a strong partner in the restoration of the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed. Our mission — to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people — compels us to address the Gulf of Mexico’s many challenges. We are also obligated to do so as the steward of America’s national wildlife refuges; as the lead federal agency for the protection of migratory birds and anadromous fish (i.e. fish that divide their lives between freshwater and the ocean); as the co-lead for the recovery of federally threatened and endangered species, including marine mammals; and as a member of the larger environmental protection community responsible for responding to oil spills and hazardous substance releases.

The Service is in charge of 235 [National Wildlife Refuges (NWR)](http://www.fws.gov/refuges/) in the Gulf of Mexico watershed that serve as the backbone for a network of conservation lands dedicated to supporting fish and wildlife populations and providing unparalleled outdoor experiences for all Americans. Our refuge stewardship responsibilities in the Gulf region began in 1904 with the establishment of Breton NWR off the coast of Louisiana. Breton NWR is the second oldest refuge in the Service’s National Wildlife Refuge system, and is one of the more than 40 refuges located along the Gulf Coast.

Additionally, the Service has field and regional representation in all 31 states in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, which stretches across five Service administrative regions (i.e., [Southeast](http://www.fws.gov/southeast/), [Southwest](http://www.fws.gov/southwest/), [Midwest](http://www.fws.gov/midwest/), [Mountain-Prairie](http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/) and [Northeast](http://www.fws.gov/northeast/)). Throughout the watershed, the Service provides a combination of conservation planning and on-the-ground contributions through our various programs focusing on such matters as [wildlife and sportfish restoration grants](http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/), refuge management, endangered species recovery work, fish and aquatic conservation, migratory birds conservation and [law enforcement activities](https://www.fws.gov/le/). The Service also plays an important role in the [U.S. Department of the Interior’s Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration](https://www.doi.gov/restoration) work relating to the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  

The Service understands that conserving habitat and maintaining functioning landscapes not only benefits fish and wildlife, but also benefits our society in the form of ecosystem services that support healthy and resilient communities and economies. The Service works with the states and others to proactively conserve hundreds of species in the Gulf region in the hopes that they will not require federal protection.
