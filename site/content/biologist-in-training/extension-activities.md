A series of group extension activities based on nationally-recognized environmental education curricula serve to supplement these BiT materials. The extension activities address differing learning styles and offer added depth of information. They include activities such as games, role-playing, art and stream studies. These extension activities along with all the materials necessary to conduct them are contained in BiT Bins available for loan at no cost through [21 Fisheries field stations](https://usfws.github.io/southeast-mega-map/) across the Southeast.
