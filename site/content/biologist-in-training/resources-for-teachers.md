The [BiT Activity Booklet](/pdf/workbook/biologist-in-training.pdf) has been designed with the needs of upper elementary science teachers in mind. The activities correlate to National Science Education Standards, and were developed by a team of teachers and environmental education experts. Activities offer different means of collecting, organizing and analyzing biological information, and focus on the students&rsquo; use of observation skills to make their own discoveries. A 60 word glossary supports information in the activities. Upon booklet completion, students are eligible to receive an official Biologist-in-Training certificate and sticker or patch.

The [BiT Activity Card](/pdf/workbook/biologist-in-training-activity-card.pdf) is geared toward pre-K and elementary aged children, and offers ideas for teachers and care-providers in guiding unstructured, free-play in natural aquatic spaces.

The activity card also contains information to families on the importance of providing regular and sustained meaningful interactions with nature for the overall health and well-being of their children. Upon completion of the activities, children are eligible to receive a Biologist-in-Training sticker.

A series of group [extension activities](/biologist-in-training/extension-activities) based on nationally-recognized environmental education curricula serve to supplement these BiT materials.

The extension activities address differing learning styles and offer added depth of information. They include activities such as games, role-playing, art and stream studies. These extension activities along with all the materials necessary to conduct them are contained in BiT Bins available for loan at no cost through <a href="http://www.fws.gov/southeast/fisheries/hatcheryindex.html">21 Fisheries field stations</a> across the Southeast.
