The Biologist-in-Training Program Development Team is made up of education professionals and environmental education experts from across the state of Kentucky. Their time, talents and expertise were instrumental in the creation of the first ever Regionally coordinated experiential environmental education program which promotes National Fish Hatcheries as unique outdoor classrooms.

The team works out of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery, so far dedicating hundreds of volunteer hours to assisting Fisheries outreach staff in every aspect of the program, including: overall concept and delivery, messages and content, compatibility with national science education standards, graphic design, support materials, and writing and editing the activity guide. Their input has been critical in designing and implementing this ground-breaking initiative. The team continues to work to enhance and grow the BiT program for the benefit of Fisheries field stations Region-wide and the tens of thousands of children these stations connect with nature every year.

  - **Jean Clement**, Teacher, Russell County Middle School, Jamestown, Kentucky
