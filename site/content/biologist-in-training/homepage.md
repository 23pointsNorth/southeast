Welcome to the Biologist-in-Training Program! This exciting program is designed to guide students through a fun, hands-on exploration of aquatic habitats.

The Southeastern U.S. is home to some of the world’s greatest diversity of fish and other aquatic species. But this wonderful diversity is being threatened as more and more aquatic species and their habitats begin to disappear. You can help by becoming involved in your community!

Fourteen National Fish Hatcheries and six Fisheries Resource Offices across the Southeast offer BiT program materials to groups and individuals at no cost. The program is most appropriately used at a National Fish Hatchery, but can easily be completed anywhere water flows.

The BiT activity booklet includes five fun, interactive activities that will help students gain the skills needed to be good biologists and discover why it’s important to care for our precious aquatic resources. Once students complete all five activities they are eligible to receive an official Biologist-in-Training certificate and patch or sticker!
