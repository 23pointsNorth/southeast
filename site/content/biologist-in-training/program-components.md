## Activity Guides

Individual students or groups may complete a BiT Activity Booklet (upper elementary ages) or BiT Activity Card (pre-K &ndash; elementary ages) at any National Fish Hatchery in the southeastern U.S., or also anywhere water flows.

## Certification

Upon completion students may earn an official Biologist-in-Training certificate, patch or sticker from a local hatchery or by mailing in a signed certification of completion (contained in the BiT Activity Booklet) along with name and address to:

USFWS Fisheries Program  
Attn: Biologist-in-Training  
1875 Century Blvd., Suite 250  
Atlanta,GA 30345

## Extension Activities

Group extension activities supplement the BiT activity guides and are offered in BiT Bins available for loan through Fisheries field stations across the Southeast.

## Workshops

Training workshop dates and locations are based on demand. Contact [biologistintraining@fws.gov](mailto:biologistintraining@fws.gov) if you would like to schedule a one-day training workshop in your area.
