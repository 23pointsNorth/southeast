This infographic discusses the impact of hurricanes in Florida during sea turtle nesting season, and asks that you never touch any exposed eggs or disturbed nests. Although nearly 90 percent of sea turtle nesting in the United States occurs in Florida in March through October, a major hurricane there during this period doesn’t mean all is lost. Mother sea turtles “hedge their bets” by depositing eggs in several nests over the course of the season, so there is a high probability that at least a few of the nests will incubate successfully even if a serious storm hits. So if you ever find exposed sea turtle eggs or a distressed nest, please don’t touch them but instead contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at [seaturtlestanding@myfwc.com](mailto:seaturtlestanding@myfwc.com) or [mtp@myfwc.com](mailto:mtp@myfwc.com).
