This infographic focuses on the $100 million fine BP paid to the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill's impact on birds. It includes photos of a male mallard duck; duck eggs in a nest; and a female mottled duck with ducklings. There are also headshots of several of the 63 species of birds injured by the oil spill (green-winged teal, mallard, piping plover, and interior least tern). Approximately $67 million has been allocated to 75 projects so far. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for evaluating project proposals and administering the grants. Not only birds benefit from these projects: hunters, birdwatchers, nature lovers and other people benefit because the funds go to conserving wetland habitat that filters drinking water; reduces coastal erosion, and provides flood control.
