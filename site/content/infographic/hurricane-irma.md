This infographic shows the eye of Hurricane Irma and details the Southeast Region response. The Service sent out teams with fuel, water, food and chainsaws to make sure that employees were safe, to inspect homes and buildings, to clear roads and to find staging areas for equipment. Hurricane Irma impacted 45 national wildlife refuges, three national fish hatcheries, two ecological services field stations, two fish and wildlife conservation offices and three law enforcement offices in the Caribbean and Southeast U.S. Employees assessed the impacts of the hurricane on wildlife such as the Key deer, manatees, Puerto Rican parrots, sea turtles and other imperiled species.
