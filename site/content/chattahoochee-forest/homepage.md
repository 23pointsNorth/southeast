Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery is nestled deep in the heart of the North Georgia mountains, approximately 75 miles north of Atlanta. Surrounded by the 749,444 acre [Chattahoochee National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/conf), the hatchery occupies a 44.8 acre tract of land straddling Mill Creek and Rock Creek, which are tributaries of the Toccoa River.

The hatchery produces about one million rainbow trout each year. These fish are stocked into tailwaters, streams and lakes of Northern Georgia in cooperation with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Corps of Engineers, Tennessee Valley Authority, and the U.S. Forest Service.
