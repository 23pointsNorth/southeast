This infographic shows the eye of Hurricane Maria and details the Southeast region response. Maria made landfall over Puerto Rico as a Category 4 Hurricane impacting 57 employees, 15 field stations and 22,000 acres. The Southeast region assisted our neighbors in Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra and St. Croix. The region accounted for all of our employees, helped FEMA with search and rescue, provided aerial transportation between islands, secured facilities with tarps and generators, provided security to DOI assets, enabled communication between local government and Service facilities, transported food, water and fuel, cleared roads, and stabilized facilities for Puerto Rican parrots. Our Incident Management and Response Teams from all over the Southeast were composed of firefighters, law enforcement officers, chainsaw operators, electricians, and more.
