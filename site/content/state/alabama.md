Reaching from its arrow-straight northern border to a spot where the land flattens and greets the Gulf of Mexico, Alabama has the most biodiverse lands and waters in the nation. This rich diversity is teeming with wildlife great and small. Some, like the threatened dark pigtoe mussel, live in the tumbling currents of Alabama’s rivers and streams. Others, like the elegant sandhill crane mount the skies on large feathered wings. Other creatures like whitetail deer and black bear prowl its forests. Alabama’s natural places attract wildlife and people alike. The Alabama outdoors abound with opportunities to enjoy wildlife and our shared natural heritage.
