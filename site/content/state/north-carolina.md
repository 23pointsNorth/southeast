## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I obtain information on endangered species?

Check out [our list of endangered species by county](https://www.fws.gov/nc-es/es/countyfr.html) or visit our page on [endangered and threatened species of North Carolina](https://www.fws.gov/raleigh/es_tes.html). Information can also be obtained by contacting our office, the [North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission](http://www.ncwildlife.org/) and the[ Department of Environment and Natural Resources](http://www.ncdenr.gov/).

### If there is an endangered species on my property, are there restrictions on what I can do?

There may be. It is illegal to harm or harass an endangered species. Harm includes destroying or modifying habitat of the species. Continuing your normal activities is no problem. If you are planning construction work or other major changes, it is best to check with our office before proceeding. You will need a special permit from us and/or the state if your work will harm a federal- or state-protected species.

### Can I still grow pine trees for silvicultural purposes and help red-cockaded woodpeckers?

Yes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been working with private landowners in the Southeast to provide guidance and management recommendations that allow silviculture (growing and cultivating trees) while conserving red-cockaded woodpeckers. Management work includes conducting certain forestry activities outside the bird’s breeding season, protecting the bird’s nesting tree cluster and using other forestry activities that benefit forestry production and the woodpecker, such as prescribed burning.

### Can I help in the recovery of endangered species, and if so, how?

First, start out at home, by being a good land steward on your property. Landscape using only native plants; they benefit local wildlife and save you money because they require less care and maintenance. Also support community involvement in conservation of wetlands, bays, rivers, forests and coastal habitats. Avoid using fertilizers and pesticides in locations that can runoff to waterways or ditches. Maintain your septic system regularly. These areas provide habitat for wildlife species as well as enjoyable recreational opportunities, drinking water supplies and economic benefits, including tourism and some industry.

### Is there money available to help wildlife on my land?

There are opportunities for cost-sharing partnerships through several federal programs. Assistance and information on these programs are available through the [Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program](https://www.fws.gov/raleigh/pfw.html).

### Can I, and how do I go about importing wildlife to the U.S.?

Contact the [Service's Law Enforcement Division](https://www.fws.gov/le/) for referral to the proper authority in Atlanta or elsewhere.

### How do I get a fishing or hunting license in North Carolina?

### What do I do with an animal that is eating my garden?
