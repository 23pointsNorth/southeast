Mississippi at first appears rather unassuming, a low-lying, pine-covered upland giving way to swampy, marshy bottomland. The river of the same name — affectionately referred to as The Big Muddy — serves as its ecological calling card. A closer look reveals a state teeming with a variety of habitats and rich biodiversity. Two-thirds of the Magnolia State is covered in hardwood and pine forests that are home to black bears, deer and turkey. A patchwork quilt of bottomland hardwood forests in the Mississippi Delta are one of the last of their kind, providing a glimpse into the past as well as excellent habitat for wintering waterfowl. Mississippi’s mosaic of fresh and saltwater wetlands and pinelands across its coastal plain are biodiverse hotspots for migratory songbirds, wading birds, and aquatic wildlife.
