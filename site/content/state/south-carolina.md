South Carolina’s renowned coastal beauty draws people from across the nation seeking to bask along the Grand Strand’s sandy beaches or stroll under the moss draped oaks of the Lowcountry. The ecological diversity of these areas attracts wildlife, too. Plovers, red knots, and other migratory shorebirds can be found probing these same beaches for their next meal while wintering waterfowl, alligators, and native fish find sanctuary in the Palmetto State’s salt marshes and tidal creeks. The coastal plain gives rise to the Sandhills, where the rolling beds of sandy soils host pockets of longleaf pine forest and are home to imperiled wildlife like red-cockaded woodpeckers and frosted flatwood salamanders. Further upstate, the cool waters of South Carolina’s mountainous rivers and streams are rich in aquatic diversity that attracts anglers in pursuit of their favored pastime.
