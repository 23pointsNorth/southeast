Puerto Rico is home some of the most diverse land and marine ecosystems in the United States. Yet, less than 10 percent of its lands are set aside for conservation. As a leader in fish and wildlife conservation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is helping to protect Puerto Rico’s natural beauty, unique ecosystems, and imperiled wildlife.

Service biologists work cooperatively with Commonwealth agencies, private landowners, and conservation organizations to protect and restore the island’s wildlife and the habitats on which they depend. One example of this collaboration is recovery efforts for the endangered Puerto Rican parrot. With its partners, the Service is conserving and managing wild and captive parrots to recover the endemic species. Today, approximately 450 parrots are distributed among Commonwealth and federal facilities.

The Service also is conserving Puerto Rico’s lands and waters at five national wildlife refuges. These refuges have the potential to support the recovery of more threatened and endangered species than any other national wildlife refuge in the Southeast Region. Many migratory birds depend on high quality habitat found at the refuges, including endemic species, birds migrating between North and South America, and others like colonially nesting seabirds that are extremely vulnerable to decline due to their unique breeding site needs.
