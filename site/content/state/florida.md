Florida is a state rich in a natural diversity of plants, animals and ecosystems. Spanning nearly 66,000 square miles, this state is home to a tremendous diversity of species that live in varied land and water habitats.

In the hardwood hammocks near Key West, you might see the endangered Stock Island tree snail. In the surf at Fernandina, you could find three species of sea turtles that we protect, and in the dunes at Perdido Key, you could spot the burrows of Perdido Key beach mice. Along that route, you would cross about 15 major rivers with Spanish, Anglo and Native American names like Santa Fe, St. John’s and Choctawhatchee. Those rivers hold manatees, American crocodiles, Gulf sturgeon, and many species of freshwater mussels.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for managing America’s trust resources in Florida for the benefit of the American people.  Using the best available science, we work to conserve and connect Florida’s unique ecosystems and habitats so that wild animals and plants can thrive.

## Habitat Restoration Projects

### The Everglades

The Everglades is recognized both nationally and internationally as one of the world's most unique natural and cultural resources. Encompassing nearly 18,000 square miles of the southern tip of the Florida peninsula, the Everglades and the greater Everglades ecosystem (spanning from the Kissimmee River basin north of Lake Okeechobee all the way south to Florida Bay) are also the focus of the world's largest intergovernmental watershed restoration effort.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is addressing an unprecedented workload to assure that an Everglades restoration plan provides maximum benefits to the diverse fish and wildlife resources of south Florida. The restoration plan as a whole and each of its components will require the Service's evaluation under the authorities of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Clean Water Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act.
