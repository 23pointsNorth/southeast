## Service area

Forty-one counties make up the Asheville ecological services field office core work area in western North Carolina, which includes many publicly owned conservation lands, especially in the higher elevations, as well as the metropolitan areas of Charlotte, Winston Salem, and Asheville. This area primarily encompasses portions of the Blue Ridge and Piedmont physiographic provinces. In addition to our core work area, the responsibilities of certain staff members extend beyond its boundaries and into adjacent states and other Service regions.
