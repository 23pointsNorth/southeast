Due to limited resources and efforts to focus those resources where conservation need is greatest, we are generally only able to offer classroom and field programs in Macon, Jackson, Graham, Swain, Haywood, Henderson, Transylvania, Yancey, and Mitchell counties.

## Field programs

### Macroinvertebrate sampling and water chemistry investigation
Grades 7-12 (45 minutes – 1.5 hours)
 
Introduces students to the diversity of life in a stream and how it’s a reflection of water quality. Participants use kick nets to collect stream insects, snails, and other macroinvertebrates. They use simple keys to identify their catch and assess the quality of the stream based on the animals they collect. 

*Note: the Fish and Wildlife Service provides equipment. Educator identifies stream for study, arranges student transportation to and from the site, and ensures organizational health and safety requirements are met.*

## Classroom programs

### About the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
Grades 8-12 (1 hour)

An introduction to the work of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, including career opportunities, and how to plan your education to become a wildlife biologist or environmental professional.

### Identifying and Treating Sources of Water Pollution
Grades 6-9 (1 hour)


What are the water quality impacts of development? How can our actions affect water quality in our own neighborhood.? This session begins with an introduction to endangered species, both globally and locally, then focuses on aquatic species. The students have an opportunity to manage their own piece of imaginary property, then assess their management for stream impacts and determine ways to minimize or prevent water pollution.
