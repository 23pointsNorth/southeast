Through its Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, the Service provides financial and technical assistance to private landowners, and local and tribal governments to improve habitat on their land.

## Types of assistance

### Technical

The Asheville field office has a biologist dedicated to working with private landowners to improve fish and wildlife habitat on their land. This biologist can conduct site visits, provide management recommendations, and help connect landowners with other resources that may help their land management.

### Financial

Through its grant program, the Partners for Fish and Wildlife program funds habitat improvements on private land.

## Who qualifies for assistance?

The program targets private landowners.

### Species that benefit

The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program focuses on improving habitat for a group of plants and animals called federal trust resources – including migratory birds and fish as well as federally threatened and endangered species.

### Geographic focus areas

The Partners for Fish & Wildlife program has identified project focus areas based on the presence of imperiled species, guidance from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission’s wildlife action plan, input from partners, a successful track record for projects, and expectation of future success. The Asheville field office provides services to these focus areas:

- Upper Coosa River basin
- Upper Little Tennessee River basin
- Upper French Broad River basin
- Upper Nolichucky River basin
- Conservation Partnership Areas for Mountain Bogs National Wildlife Refuge

## Priority habitats

Within the geographic focus areas there are priority habitat types, generally Appalachian bogs, streams, or areas immediately adjacent to streams - habitats considered key to conserving priority species.

## Landowner commitment

To participate in the program, landowners commit to keep the land in the restored state for at least 10 years, and are encouraged to contribute to the project through cost-sharing or in-kind services.
