Any plant or animal that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list and protect under the Endangered Species Act is considered “[at-risk](/endangered-species-act/at-risk-species).”

When we are petitioned to provide federal protection to a species, our biologists review the information presented by the petitioner as well as the information in our files prior to the date of the petition to determine whether a closer look at the species’ status is advisable.

The following species occur in the southeastern states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. All except the wingtail crayfish were included in a [2012 petition from the Center for Biological Diversity to list 53 reptiles and amphibians](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/petitions/92210/662.pdf).

We have summarized the petitioner’s claims as well as our findings below. More detail is available by clicking the link to the Federal Register docket number for each species.


## Not substantial findings

Five petitioned species found in the Southeast will not be given further consideration for federal protection at this time.

### [Blue Ridge gray-cheeked salamander](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=D04C)

Federal Register docket: [FWS–R4–ES–2015–0042](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FWS-R4-ES-2015-0042)

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/blue-ridge-gray-cheeked-salamander.jpg" alt="A salamander standing on a mossy rock." caption="Blue Ridge grey-cheeked salamander.

Known occurrences: North Carolina

The Center claims that the salamander warrants listing due to:

- Habitat destruction due to clear-cutting
- Overutilization for commercial purposes
- Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
- Natural or man-made factors including random events, human impacts, environmental factors, loss of genetic variability, inbreeding depression

Based on our review of the petition and sources cited in the petition, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action, to list the species, may be warranted.

### [Caddo Mountain salamander](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=D01W)

Federal Register docket: [FWS–R4–ES–2015–0043](http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=FWS-R4-ES-2015-0043)

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/caddo-mountain-salamander.jpg" alt="A speckled salamander walking across a moss and fungi." caption="Blue Ridge grey-cheeked salamander.

Known occurrences: Arkansas

The Center claims that the salamander warrants listing due to:

- Habitat loss/destruction/modification from timber management, forestry activities, and mining
- Scientific over-collection
- Disease (chigger infestation of the nasal cavities)
- Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
- Natural or man-made factors including climate change

Based on our review of the petition and sources cited in the petition, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action, to list the species, may be warranted.

### Pigeon Mountain salamander

Federal Register docket: [FWS–R4–ES–2015–0058](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FWS-R4-ES-2015-0058)

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/pigeon-mountain-salamander.jpg" alt="A brown salamander standing on a rock." caption="Blue Ridge grey-cheeked salamander. Photo by [John Clare](https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnclare/), [CC BY-NC-ND 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/)" link="https://flic.kr/p/eLEEwc" >}}

Known occurrences: Georgia

The Center claims that the salamander warrants listing due to:

- Threats of habitat loss/destruction/modification from timber harvest
- Over-collection of the salamander by amateur and professional herpetologists
- Protection by the State of Georgia does not protect its habitat
- Small and isolated populations that may be affected by natural and man-made factors including random events, gene flow, loss of genetic variation, and disturbance from recreational spelunkers

Based on our review of the petition and sources cited in the petition, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action, to list the species, may be warranted.

Additional information on this species is available in this [fact sheet](http://georgiawildlife.com/sites/default/files/wrd/pdf/fact-sheets/pigeon_mountain_salamander_2009.pdf) by our state partners, Georgia Wildlife Resources Division.

### [Weller's salamander](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=9280)

Federal Register docket: [FWS–R4–ES–2015–0065](https://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=FWS-R4-ES-2015-0065)

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/wellers-salamander.jpg" alt="A dark salamander with gold splotches standing on a leaf." caption="Blue Ridge grey-cheeked salamander.

Known occurrences: North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia

The Center claims that the salamander warrants listing due to:

- Loss of habitat due to development and logging
- Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
- Natural or man-made factors including climate change and small, isolated populations vulnerable to random events, gene flow and loss of genetic variation

Based on our review of the petition and sources cited in the petition, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action, to list the species, may be warranted.

### Wingtail crayfish

*_This species was petitioned for federal protection in a separate petition by the Center for Biological Diversity but has been included in this batch of 90-day findings._

Federal Register docket: [FWS–R4–ES–2015–0067](https://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=FWS-R4-ES-2015-0067)

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/wingtail-crayfish.jpg" alt="A semi-transparent crayfish with black and brown spots." caption="Blue Ridge grey-cheeked salamander. Wingtail crayfish, _Procambarus latipleurum_. Photo by Edwin Keppner." link="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/resourcespace/pages/search.php?search=%21collection346&k=3f6f2c2bdc" >}}

Known occurrences: Gulf County, Florida

The Center claims that the crayfish warrants listing due to:

- Threats of habitat loss/destruction/modification from development, altered hydropatterns, roadside ditch maintenance, construction and improvement of roads, human population growth, groundwater decline, water pollution and forestry
- Disease
- Predation
- Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
- Natural or man-made factors including vulnerability to extinction due to a narrow geographic range, drought, flooding, climate change and sea level rise, off-road vehicles, misidentification

Based on our review of the petition and sources cited in the petition, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action, to list the species, may be warranted.

## Substantial findings

A more thorough scientific review known as a 12-month finding has been triggered for the following species. The Fish and Wildlife Service will seek to collect additional scientific and commercial data to determine whether these species may require federal protection.
