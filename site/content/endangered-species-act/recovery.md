We seek to not only prevent plants and animals from going extinct, we want to return them to a level of health where protection under the Endangered Species Act is no longer necessary. This process is called **recovery**.

Bringing a species back from the brink of extinction is a challenge that takes time. In some cases, we are attempting to combat population declines more than 200 years in the making.

Achieving recovery for threatened and endangered species requires cooperative conservation efforts. The collaborative efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its many partners (Federal, State, and local agencies, tribes, conservation organizations, private landowners, concerned citizens, and the business community) are critical to the recovery of listed species.

### Plans for Recovering Species

We outline the actions that need to be taken in order to bring a species back from the brink of extinction in documents called **recovery plans**. You can find the recovery plan for any protected species using our [Environmental Conservation Online System (ECOS)](http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/speciesRecovery.jsp?sort=1).

### Recovery Programs

Some species have entire teams of biologists dedicated to their recovery. Learn more about the species and their program below:
