Listing a plant or animal as federally protected under the Endangered Species Act is proven to be successful in preventing extinction.

However, providing a plant or animal this level of protection is America’s last line of defense. There are tremendous opportunities for **voluntary conservation actions**, undertaken **before a species requires listing**, to preclude the need to list species and improve habitats for listed, at-risk and common species alike.

A plant or animal is considered **“at-risk”** when:

 - It is proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act,
 - It is a candidate species for listing, or
 - It has been petitioned by a third party for listing.

## Online Tool for Tracking At-Risk Species

We have developed a free, online tool, the [At-Risk Species Finder](https://fws.gov/southeast/candidateconservation/finder2), that allows anyone to discover essential information about a species’ status and the lead U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office for that species.

When determining whether or not a species requires the protection of the Act, we assign a Field Office as lead for reviewing all the best scientific and commercial information on the species’ status. Field Offices will have the most information on a particular at-risk species, and all offices follow the same process to determine whether or not a species may require federal protection.

Using the Finder, you can search species by:

 - Common and scientific name
 - State range
 - Taxon
 - Lead USFWS office or region
 - Current status
 - And more.
