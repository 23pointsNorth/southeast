Any plant or animal that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list and protect under the Endangered Species Act is considered "[at-risk](/endangered-species-act/at-risk-species)." Recognizing that conservation is only successful through partnerships, the Service leveraged the work of state wildlife agencies and a variety of other conservation partners to assess whether these species at-risk require protection under the Act.

Since receipt of the 2010 petitions, 60 southeastern species have not required federal protection as a result of either conservation actions, additional information (e.g., updated survey data), reevaluation of threats to their survival, and a lack of substantial information indicating further need for evaluation since 2010. Those same partnerships have ensured another 11 species now require less protection or no protection at all.

## About the petitions

When we are petitioned to provide federal protection to a species, our biologists review the information presented by the petitioner as well as the information in our files prior to the date of the petition, to determine whether a closer look at the species&rsquo; status is advisable.

The six species included in these findings came from the following petitions to list them under the Endangered Species Act:

- [2015 petition to list the southern dusky salamander](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/petitions/92000//568.docx) from the Coastal Plains Institute and Land Conservancy
- [2014 petition to list 9 Caribbean skinks](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/petitions/92100/587.pdf) from the Center for Biological Diversity
  - This batch contains a 90-day finding for the Monito skink
  - Findings for 7 of the 9 skinks were published in the Federal Register as part of a 90-day finding batch on January 12, 2016
  - There is one remaining skink from this petition, the Lesser Virgin Islands skink will be addressed in a separate evaluation
- [2012 petition to list 53 amphibians and reptiles](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/petitions/92210/662.pdf) from the Center for Biological Diversity which includes the Cheoah bald salamander and South Mountain gray-cheeked salamander
- [2015 petition to list the yellow banded bumblebee](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/petitions/92000/681.pdf) from the Defenders of Wildlife
- [2015 petition to delist the American burying beetle](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/petitions/92220/677.pdf) from the American Stewards of Liberty, Independent Petroleum Association of America, Texas Public Policy Foundation, and  Dr. Steven W. Carothers

We have summarized our findings below. More detail is available by clicking the link to the Federal Register docket number for each species.

## Not substantial findings

Four petitioned species found in the Southeast will not be given further consideration for federal protection at this time. If you have further questions, visit our [information page on 90-day findings](/endangered-species-act/90-day-finding) or contact Andreas Moshogianis at [andreas_moshogianis@fws.gov](mailto:andreas_moshogianis@fws.gov?subject=March+2016+Batch+Findings) or 404-679-7119.

### Cheoah bald salamander

Federal Register docket: [FWS–R4–ES–2015-0081](https://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=FWS-R4-ES-2015-0081)

Known occurrences: North Carolina
The Center claims that the salamander warrants listing due to:

- Habitat destruction due to clearcutting
- Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
- Natural or manmade factors including small, isolated population dynamics

Based on our review of the petition and sources cited in the petition, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action, to list the species, may be warranted.

### South Mountain gray-cheeked salamander

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/south-mountain-gray-cheeked-salamander.jpg" alt="A dark colored salamander standing on green moss." caption="South Mountain gray-cheeked salamander by [John P.

Federal Register docket: [FWS–R4–ES–2015-0117](https://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=FWS-R4-ES-2015-0117)

Known occurrences: North Carolina

The Center claims that the salamander warrants listing due to:

- Habitat destruction due to clearcutting and residential development
- Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
- Natural or manmade factors including small, isolated population dynamics

Based on our review of the petition and sources cited in the petition, the Fish and Wildlife Service finds that the petition does not provide substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action, to list the species, may be warranted.

### Southern dusky salamander
