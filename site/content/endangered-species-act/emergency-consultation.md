Occasionally, Federal Agencies must respond to emergency situations where human life and  property are in danger. In these situations, compliance with the Endangered Species Act must be a lower priority until the Federal Agency completes their response to the emergency situation.

The Endangered Species Act and its implementing regulations recognize the necessity to respond immediately to  emergencies and provide special procedures that allow Federal Agencies the latitude necessary to complete their emergency  responses in order to secure human life and property without  delay while still providing them with protections that normal compliance under the Endangered Species Act would have afforded them.

It is the Fish and Wildlife Service&rsquo;s policy to assist Federal Agencies with their Endangered Species  Act compliance issues during an emergency response, but to never delay the necessary response to secure human  life and property.

The links below are provided to assist you in understanding  emergency provisions under the Endangered Species Act, to provide access to  pre-existing policies and guidance for emergency responses, and to illustrate  typical emergency responses that the Southeast Region has provided in the past:
