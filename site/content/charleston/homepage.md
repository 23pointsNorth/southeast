Established in 1973, the South Carolina Ecological Services Field Office (SCESFO), located in Charleston, South Carolina, is primarily focused on protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species, while also supporting conservation of migratory birds, fish, and wetlands. The SCESFO also coordinates with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) to address priority species outlined in their South Carolina Wildlife Action Plan.

The SCESFO works in partnership with South Carolina’s National Wildlife Refuges and National Fish Hatcheries. Protecting over 192,000 acres of fish and wildlife habitat and providing exceptional recreational opportunities for the public, these facilities of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service serve as models for effective conservation and recovery of threatened and endangered species and other species of emerging conservation priority.

The field office provides services to private citizens, community groups, local governments, schools, conservation partners, and other federal and state agencies.

## Goals

- Conduct consultation, habitat conservation planning activities, and candidate conservation activities under the Endangered Species Act;
- Reduce impacts to fish, wildlife, and their habitats in the state from federally funded or authorized projects (e.g., Federal Energy Regulatory Commission activities);
- Restore habitat through the Service’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife and Coastal programs;
  Conserve wetlands;
- Identify, reduce, and prevent contamination of fish and wildlife resources through technical assistance, investigations, monitoring, and technical reviews of environmental contaminant issues;
- Protect the ecological integrity of our national wildlife refuges and national fish hatcheries statewide;
- Conserve migratory birds; and
- Conduct education and outreach activities in support of fish and wildlife conservation.

## Service area

The SCESFO covers the entire state of South Carolina: 46 counties, over 31,000 square miles, and 187 miles of general coastline.
