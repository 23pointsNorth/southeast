Then Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program works with voluntary habitat improvement projects on private lands for the benefit of federal trust species. Such species include such as migratory birds and migratory fish, endangered or threatened species, and at-risk species that have been proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), are candidates for listing under the ESA, species that have been petitioned for listing under the ESA , or are Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) as identified by the states. Biologists provide technical and financial assistance to landowners who want to restore and enhance habitats on their property.

## How to participate

- Interested landowners contact a Partners for Fish and Wildlife biologist to discuss the proposed project and establish a site visit.
- A visit to the site is used to determine which activities the landowner desires and how those activities will enhance habitat for trust resources.
- Technical advice on the proposed activities is provided by the Service, as appropriate.
- Proposed cost estimates are discussed by the Service and landowner.
- A proposal which describes the proposed activities is developed by the Service biologist and the landowner. Projects are then regionally ranked for potential funding.
- After funding is approved, the landowner and the Service co-sign a Wildlife Extension Agreement.
- Projects installation begins.
- The Service reimburses the landowner after receipts and other documentation are submitted according to the Wildlife Extension Agreement, when the project is completed.

## Types of projects

- Livestock exclusion fencing/alternate water supply construction;
- Streambank stabilization;
- Restoration of native vegetation;
- Wetland restoration/enhancement;
- Riparian reforestation; and
- Restoration of in-stream aquatic habitats.

## General requirements

- Projects must benefit federal trust resources including threatened or endangered species, wetlands, migratory birds or at-risk species;
- Minimum ten year agreement;
- Voluntary participation;
- Landowner does not forfeit property rights; and
- Activities will benefit wildlife.
