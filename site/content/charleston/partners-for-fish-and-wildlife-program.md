The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program works with voluntary habitat improvement projects on private lands for the benefit of federal trust resources, such as [endangered or threatened species](/charleston/endangered-species/) and [at-risk species](/charleston/at-risk-species) (ARS). Biologists provide technical and financial assistance to landowners who want to restore and enhance habitats on their property.

## How to participate

- Interested landowners contact a Partners for Fish and Wildlife biologist to discuss the proposed project and establish a site visit.
- A visit to the site is used to determine which activities the landowner desires and how those activities will enhance habitat for trust resources.
- Technical advice on the proposed activities is provided by the Service, as appropriate.
- Proposed cost estimates are discussed by the Service and landowner.
- A proposal which describes the proposed activities is developed by the Service biologist and the landowner. Projects are then regionally ranked for potential funding.
- After funding is approved, the landowner and the Service co-sign a Wildlife Extension Agreement.
- Landowner initiates project.
- The Service reimburses the landowner after receipts and other documentation are submitted according to the Wildlife Extension Agreement, when the project is completed.

## Types of projects

- Livestock exclusion fencing/alternate water supply construction;
- Streambank stabilization;
- Restoration of native vegetation;
- Wetland restoration/enhancement;
- Riparian reforestation; and
- Restoration of in-stream aquatic habitats.

## General requirements

- Projects must benefit Federal trust resources including threatened or endangered species and/or ARS;
- Minimum ten year agreement;
- Voluntary participation;
- Landowner does not forfeit property rights; and
- Activities will benefit wildlife.
