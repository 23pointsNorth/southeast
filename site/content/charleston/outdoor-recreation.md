Our nation has one of the world's largest networks of protected public lands set aside for the enjoyment of the American people.  This vast network supports a healthy outdoor recreation industry, providing millions of jobs across the U.S. and generating billions of dollars for the economy.  These jobs and revenue in turn help support local communities and fund conservation efforts.  So whether you are hunting, fishing, or hiking, you're not just renewing your spirit and improving your health, you're also contributing to the future of conserving and enhancing our natural heritage for future generations.

With several National Wildlife Refuges and National Fish Hatcheries in South Carolina, there are a wealth experiences to be had year-round.  Besides hunting and fishing, some of the other priority uses of these special places are wildlife observation, photography, environmental education and interpretation.  For current information on each facility, please call their office or visit their websites.  Rules, regulations, and conditions are updated regularly and may be subject to change.
