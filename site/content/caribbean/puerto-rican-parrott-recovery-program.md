The Puerto Rican parrot recovery program is an effort to conserve, protect and manage wild and captive parrots in order to downlist the species from endangered to threatened.

The Iguaca, as the Taino Indians named it, is found only in Puerto Rico. There are three wild populations, including the oldest group in El Yunque National Forest. The second group of parrots is in the Río Abajo State Forest. [A third population was introduced into Maricao Commonwealth Forest in November of 2016](/articles/a-new-beginning-puerto-rican-parrots-reintroduced-into-maricao-commonwealth-forest/).
