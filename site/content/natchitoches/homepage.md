Natchitoches National Fish Hatchery, the only federal fish hatchery in Louisiana, is one of 69 Federal fish hatcheries across the United States. Opened in 1931, the hatchery raises many species of fish including alligator gar, alligator snapping turtles, recreational fish species, and freshwater mussels.  

Louisiana is called Sportsmanâ€™s Paradise reflecting a history steeped in the environment.  As we work to protect our natural resources, we also aim to protect the cultural heritage of the people who were here long before us.  Natchitoches NFH has been working with the Caddo Indian Nation for years to develop educational resources for the local school systems that teach about the Caddo way of life.  The aquarium at Natchitoches NFH contains displays featuring the Caddo people who use to inhabit the very land the hatchery is built on.  In addition to our indoor displays there is also a memorial plaza located on the side of the aquarium, dedicated to remembering the Caddo people who lived, died and were buried on now what is known at Natchitoches National Fish Hatchery.
