National Fish Hatcheries play an important role in managing and restoring America’s fisheries.  Hatcheries across the Southeast produce both game and non-game species, which contributes to habitat conservation, endangered species recovery, and provides recreation opportunities to the nation’s anglers.

## Broodstock Hatcheries

The majority of National Fish Hatcheries across the Southeast region do not typically keep adult fish for breeding purposes.  Instead, a select few broodstock hatcheries produce and provide disease-free, fertilized fish eggs to federal, state, and tribal hatcheries to support their fishery management efforts.  Broodstock hatcheries also provide eggs to research centers, classrooms, and universities.  While producing millions of eggs annually these facilities focus on preserving genetic diversity to support healthy populations of fish into the future.  A small number of eggs produced in broodstock hatcheries are hatched and reared on site so the facility can continue to produce eggs year in and year out.

## Mitigation of Federal Water Development Projects

Dams often provide benefits to people including energy production, recreation opportunities, and flood control, but can also have other, unintended, impacts on fish species. Stream barriers can prevent fish from migrating up streams and rivers, which can affect a species’ ability to reproduce. Dams that hold back water to create large reservoirs can have a big impact on the temperature of water.  In summer months heat from the sun reaches the reservoir, which warms the upper layers of the water while deeper water remains much colder.  When the water released from a dam comes from deeper, cooler water, it changes the habitat below the dam.  The original, warmwater fish habitat, which supported native species like crappie and smallmouth bass, cannot support these same species in the new cold habitat.

Here in the Southeast, our hatcheries can mitigate for these changes in habitat by producing  coldwater gamefish such as rainbow trout that will thrive in the coldwater habitats below Corps of Engineer (COE) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) dams.   Stocking coldwater gamefish provides fishing opportunities below these dams, which create a considerable economic and recreational value for local and regional communities.
