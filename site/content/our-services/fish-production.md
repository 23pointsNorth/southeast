National Fish Hatcheries play an important role in managing and restoring America’s fisheries.  Hatcheries across the Southeast produce both game and non-game species, which contributes to habitat conservation, endangered species recovery, and provides recreation opportunities to the nation’s anglers.

## Broodstock Hatcheries

The majority of National Fish Hatcheries across the Southeast region do not typically keep adult fish for breeding purposes.  Instead, a select few broodstock hatcheries produce and provide disease-free, fertilized fish eggs to federal, state, and tribal hatcheries to support their fishery management efforts.  Broodstock hatcheries also provide eggs to research centers, classrooms, and universities.  While producing millions of eggs annually these facilities focus on preserving genetic diversity to support healthy populations of fish into the future.  A small number of eggs produced in broodstock hatcheries are hatched and reared on site so the facility can continue to produce eggs year in and year out.

## Mitigation of Federal Water Development Projects

Federal water development projects, such as  Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) dams  provide benefits to people including energy production, recreational opportunities, and flood control.  Water releases from the operation of these dams create cold tailwaters, which can have unintended impacts on native fish species and their habitat.  Water temperatures of large reservoirs stratify near the dam and forms layers of warm, cool, and cold water.

In summer months, heat from the sun reaches the reservoir and warms the upper layers of the water while deeper water remains much colder.  During operations of the dam, the water or tailwater below the dam comes from the deep cold water layers of the reservoir.  As a result, the once free flowing warmwater fish habitat that supported native species like crappie and smallmouth bass has been altered to a  coldwater habitat that is not as conducive to the native warmwater fish species.  Dams are also barriers  to the natural migration of native fish moving within streams and rivers and may impair the  species’ ability to reproduce.  Other impediments caused from water releases are fluctuations in water levels and  flow and seasonally may  adversely affect the water quality in the tailwater. Here in the Southeast, our hatcheries can mitigate for these changes in habitat by producing  coldwater gamefish such as rainbow trout that will thrive in the coldwater habitats below  COE and TVA dams. Stocking coldwater gamefish provides fishing opportunities below these dams, which create a considerable economic and recreational value for local and regional communities.
