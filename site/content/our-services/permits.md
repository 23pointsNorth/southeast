The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southeast Region issues permits under [various wildlife laws and treaties](http://www.fws.gov/permits/ltr/ltr.html).  Our permits enable the public to engage in legitimate wildlife-related activities that would otherwise be prohibited by law.  Service permit programs ensure that such activities are carried out in a manner that safeguards wildlife.  Additionally, some  permits promote conservation efforts by authorizing scientific research, generating data, or allowing wildlife management and rehabilitation activities to go forward.

**We do not issue hunting and fishing licenses. Instead, those are issued by State wildlife agencies.**

## Endangered Species Permits

These permits are provided by our Field Offices located in the affected state.

 - [Contact the Field Office near you](https://usfws.github.io/southeast-mega-map/?layers=ecological+services)
 - [Instructions on how to apply for permits affecting endangered and threatened species native to the United States](http://www.fws.gov/endangered/permits/how-to-apply.html)

### Incidental Take Permits

Required when non-Federal activities will result in take of threatened or endangered species. A [habitat conservation plan](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/hcp-overview.html) or "HCP" must accompany an application for an incidental take permit. The habitat conservation plan associated with the permit ensures the effects of the authorized incidental take are adequately minimized and mitigated.

### Enhancement of Survival Permits

Issued to non-Federal landowners participating in [Safe Harbor Agreements](https://www.fws.gov/ENDANGERED/landowners/safe-harbor-agreements.html) or [Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/cca.html#ccaa). These agreements encourage landowners to take actions to benefit species while also providing assurances that they will not be subject to additional regulatory restrictions as a result of their conservation actions.

### Recovery and Interstate Commerce Permits

Issued to allow for take as part of activities intended to foster the recovery of listed species. A typical use of a recovery permit is to allow for scientific research on a listed species in order to understand better the speciesâ€™ long-term survival needs. Interstate commerce permits also allow transport and sale of listed species across State lines (e.g., for recovery purposes such as a breeding program).
