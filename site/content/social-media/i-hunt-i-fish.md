Americans who go hunting and fishing make vital economic contributions to the conservation of America’s wildlife resources. Through the [Pittman-Robertson Act](http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/GrantPrograms/WR/WR_Act.htm), American hunters and shooters contributed [over $800 million](http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/GrantPrograms/WR/WRFinalApportionment2015.pdf) to conservation projects nationwide last year!

However, many American’s are unaware of how hunting and fishing supports wildlife conservation. **To help raise awareness, we’d like you to tell us your stories about why you go fishing or hunting so that we can share it here and on social media.**

## How to Participate

Share a photo and the reason why you hunt or fish using the hashtag #iHuntbecause or #iFishbecause and tag us on Twitter [@USFWSSoutheast](http://www.twitter.com/usfwssoutheast/), Instagram [@USFWS](http://www.instagram.com/usfws/) or [@USFWSSoutheast](http://www.facebook.com/USFWSSoutheast/) on Facebook.

As part of this movement, we adopted the #ihuntbecause #ifishbecause social media campaign. This initiative’s focus is on promoting people to use the hashtag #ihuntbecause #ifishbecause on their hunting and fishing pictures with a brief statement and/or story explaining the reason why they hunt or fish.

The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program facilitates partnerships with state and non-governmental organizations to support the management of fish, wildlife and their habitats in the United States.
