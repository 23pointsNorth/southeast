##  What action is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service taking?

The Service is proposing to designate critical habitat for the Suwannee moccasinshell under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

##  What is the range of the Suwannee moccasinshell?

The Suwannee moccasinshell, a small freshwater mussel, was historically present throughout much of the Suwannee River Basin; including the Suwannee River main stem in Florida, Santa River sub-basin in Florida, and the Withlacoochee River in Florida and Georgia. The current range of the Suwannee moccasinshell now only includes the middle Suwannee River and the lower Santa Fe River. Recent surveys targeting the species indicate it has declined in abundance and range, and that it may be extirpated from the Withlacoochee River and upper Santa Fe River sub-basin.

## What areas are proposed for critical habitat designation for the Suwannee moccasinshell?

The Service is proposing to designate critical habitat for the Suwannee moccasinshell in three separate units across approximately 190 miles of stream channel in Alachua, Bradford, Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, Hamilton, Lafayette, Madison, Suwannee, and Union Counties in Florida; and in Brooks and Lowndes Counties in Georgia. Land ownership adjacent to the critical habitat area consists of private (72 percent), state (27 percent), and county (1 percent). No terrestrial lands are included in the proposed designation, only stream channels up to the ordinary high water line.

## What are the specifics on the proposed Suwannee moccasinshell critical habitat designation within the three units?

### Unit 1

Suwannee River, Florida encompasses 116 miles of the Suwannee River main stem and lower Santa Fe River in Alachua, Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, Lafayette, Madison and Suwannee Counties, Florida. This unit is currently occupied by the Suwannee moccasinshell and represents 61 percent of the total proposed critical habitat designation. The Suwannee River portion of this unit overlaps critical habitat already designated for Gulf sturgeon.

### Unit 2

Upper Santa Fe River, Florida encompasses 27 miles of the Santa Fe and New Rivers in Alachua, Bradford, Columbia, and Union Counties, Florida. This unit is considered unoccupied currently. This unit overlaps with critical habitat already designated for the oval pigtoe mussel.

### Unit 3

Withlacoochee River, Florida and Georgia encompasses 47 miles of the Withlacoochee River in Hamilton and Madison Counties, Florida; and in Brooks and Lowndes Counties, Georgia. This unit is considered unoccupied currently. A portion of the lower part of this unit overlaps with Gulf sturgeon critical habitat.

## Why is the Suwannee moccasinshell in trouble?

The primary reason for the Suwannee moccasinshell’s decline is the degradation of its habitat because of runoff from agricultural lands; pollutants that may be discharged or accidentally released from industrial and municipal wastewater facilities and from mining operations; and decreased flows as a result of groundwater extraction and drought. These threats occur throughout its range, but are more intense in two tributaries: the Withlacoochee and Santa Fe River systems.

Other threats to the species include more frequent and intense droughts, heavy rainfall events, and increased temperatures as a result of climate change; greater vulnerability to certain threats because of its small population size and range; and competition and disturbance from the invasive Asian clam.

## How is critical habitat defined?

[Critical habitat](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/critical-habitats.html) is a term under the ESA that identifies geographic areas containing features essential to the conservation of a listed species and which may require special management considerations or protection. Specifying the location of habitat essential to the conservation of the species helps federal agencies identify where to utilize their authorities to benefit listed species. The designation also helps focus the conservation efforts of other conservation partners, such as state and local governments, non-governmental organizations and individuals.

However, a critical habitat designation does not signal that habitat outside the designated area is unimportant or may not be beneficial for recovery of the species. The Suwannee moccasinshell and its habitat are fully protected under the ESA wherever they occur. F[ederal agencies will continue to consult](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/consultations-overview.html) with the Service on any action they conduct, fund and/or permit that might affect the species regardless of location or designation and the taking of any individual of the species, including taking caused by actions that affect habitat, is still prohibited without a federal permit.

When critical habitat is designated, this responsibility broadens to include consideration of any destruction or adverse modification to critical habitat that could result from a proposed federal action. Designating critical habitat also provides non-regulatory benefits by informing the public of areas that are important to the species' recovery and identifying where conservation actions would be most effective.

Designation of critical habitat does not affect land ownership or establish a wildlife refuge or preserve. A critical habitat designation does not impose restrictions on non-federal lands unless federal funds, permits, or activities are involved.

## Does a critical habitat designation change protection under the ESA?

No. Once a species is listed under the ESA, it is protected wherever it occurs, and federal agencies are required to consult on any action they conduct, fund, and/or permit that might affect the species. The ESA requires the Service to identify the location of habitat essential to the conservation of the species, which the ESA terms “critical habitat.”

Only if an activity is authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency will the agency need to work with the Service to help project applicants avoid, reduce or mitigate potential impacts to listed species or their identified habitat.

## Your proposal indicates there may be a need for special management considerations. What does that mean?

The physical and biological features essential to the conservation of this species may require special management considerations or protection to eliminate or reduce the following threats: reduced flows, nonpoint source pollution (from stormwater runoff or infiltration), point source pollution (from wastewater discharges or accidental releases), and physical alterations to the stream channel (for example, dredging, straightening, impounding, etc.).

To accomplish this, special management considerations or protections can include (but are not limited to): (1) moderation of surface and groundwater withdrawals; (2) improvement of the treatment of wastewater discharged from permitted facilities and the operation of those facilities; (3) reductions in pesticide and fertilizer use, especially in groundwater recharge areas and near stream channels; (4) use of best management practices (BMPs) designed to reduce sedimentation, erosion, and stream bank alterations; (5) protection and restoration of land immediately adjacent to or near creek/river banks (riparian buffers); and (6) avoidance of physical alterations to the stream channel.

## What impact would the designation of critical habitat for the Suwannee moccasinshell have on landowners adjacent to these units?

Designation of critical habitat does not affect land ownership or establish a wildlife refuge or preserve. Nor does it generally impact private landowners taking actions on their land that do not involve federal activities or require federal funding or permits. For the most part, landowners would see negligible change.

## What would the critical habitat designation mean for federal agencies?

For the most part, federal agencies would see negligible change in how consultations with the Service occur.

## Was an economic analysis completed to determine impacts the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Suwannee moccasinshell might have on various sectors of the economy?

Yes. A draft economic analysis was conducted to determine the potential impact of the Suwannee moccasinshell’s critical habitat designation on various sectors of the economy. Based on the best available information, the Service estimates that the designation may cost less than $20,000 annually for Suwannee and Santa Fe River units and less than $80,000 per year for the Withlacoochee River unit. The Withlacoochee River unit’s slightly higher costs are due to planned transportation projects in that area.
