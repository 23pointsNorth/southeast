## The Service says the beaverpond marstonia is presumed to be extinct, but is not stating definitively it is extinct. What is the difference?

As required by the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Service used the best available scientific and commercial information in evaluating the status of the beaverpond marstonia. As a result of multiple surveys conducted since the last time the species was documented in 2000, no individuals have been located. Based on those data and the lack of evidence that the species continues to exist, the Service determined the small snail is presumed extinct.

While the Service currently presumes the beaverpond marstonia to be extinct, it welcomes any new information, including verified observations of new specimens. The Service encourages continued surveys, and if the species is later found to still exist, the Service will reevaluate its
status.

## Has the Service previously considered the beaverpond marstonia for potential listing under the ESA?

Yes. The beaverpond marstonia was previously considered for listing and was designated as a Category 2 candidate species. At the time, the designation meant that some information was available indicating it was in need of federal protection, but additional information was needed to decide whether to list it under the ESA. This category was discontinued in 1996 when the Service switched to maintaining only a list of candidate species with sufficient information to support a proposal to list as threatened or endangered, but for which preparation and publication of a proposal was precluded by higher priority actions.

## What role did lawsuits from outside groups play in the process?

The 12-month finding on the beaverpond marstonia is part of a 2011 settlement entered into with Center for Biological Diversity and Wild Earth Guardians to address the status of species on the ESA Candidate List at that time. The deadline for making the determination for this species was extended. This announcement fulfills the part of the agreement for this species.
