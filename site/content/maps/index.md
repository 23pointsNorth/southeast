In the Southeast region we use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and location data to perform spatial analysis and to produce maps.  Spatial data plays a very important role in decision making.  For example, the Service uses location data on threatened and endangered species to consult with developers in order to avoid impacts to these species.  We use environmental data to create models that predict the locations of rare species or to prioritize locations for restoration. The [Southeast Region's GIS Steering Committee](#regional-gis-steering-committee) meets several times each year to facilitate data collection, sharing, and spatial analysis.

## Training Opportunities

The committee also provides an annual GIS training opportunity each summer in Cookeville, TN.  The National Conservation Training Center in Shepherdstown, WV provides GIS [training opportunities](https://training.fws.gov/NCTCWeb/catalog/CourseSearch.aspx) throughout the year.

### Annual GIS Training

We are excited to announce our 2017 Regional GIS Training at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, TN on Tuesday, May 16, 2017 beginning at 8:00 AM Central and ending on Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 5pm. **Tuition is free,** the only cost for the training are travel and lodging expenses. The training is open to any interested southeast region employee with supervisory approval. Enrollment for other FWS, DOI, Federal, or State employees will be open on a space-available basis once Regional requests are accommodated.

If you are interested in attending, please send an e-mail to [Matthew Snider](mailto:matthew_snider@fws.gov?subject=Annual%20GIS%20Training) or [Jason Duke](mailto:jason_duke@fws.gov?subject=Annual%20GIS%20Training) with the name, job title, office, phone, and e-mail of EACH attendee from your office. We need an accurate head count by April 14, 2017. Course lists will be e-mailed to everyone we have on record as of that date to allow you to pre-register for the course offerings. A detailed agenda will be sent at that time.

The training will open with a general 4 hour plenary session to be followed by multiple tracks of courses. There will be an Intro track, an Intermediate and an Advanced track. Caty McCurdy will lead the Intro to GIS course for a full 3-day period and a team of instructors will lead the Intermediate track. All courses are hands-on and will be taught using ArcGIS 10.4.1 and extensions. We are targeting different training opportunities for all levels of GIS knowledge and skill.

We look forward to seeing you in Cookeville!
