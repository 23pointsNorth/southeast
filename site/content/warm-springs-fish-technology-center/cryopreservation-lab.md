The U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Cryopreservation Laboratory conducts cooperative studies that develop, promote, and support methodologies and technologies resulting in healthy fish populations.  We provide consolidated technical support to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners.

## What we do

Cryopreservation is a process in which a living cell is frozen, stored, and thawed and remains viable. Cryopreserved sperm assists reproductive efforts by allowing spawning to take place whenever females are ready, reduces the need to hold males, and can increase flexibility and genetic diversity in spawning protocols.  We develop cryopreservation techniques for imperiled fish, freshwater mussels, and amphibians to support regional fisheries operations.

Our goal is to develop gamete preservation methods that are predictable and effective.  We work with internal and external partners to develop and improve fisheries management goals within the Southeast Region and in other U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regions across the country.  Through a partnership role with other Service programs, federal agencies, states, tribes, and the private sector, the Warm Springs Fish Technology Center provides a vital link in the Service's commitment to conservation of our nation's aquatic resources.  Developing and applying cryogenic techniques used for reproductive biology will strengthen the Fish Technology Center’s role in fisheries stewardship work.

## How we do it

Currently for fish, sperm is the only gamete that can successfully be cryopreserved. Species with freshwater, marine, and anadromous lifestyles have been studied.

Cryopreservation is a relatively new field. The first fish sperm was cryopreserved by Blaxter in 1953. Due to the fact that the field of cryopreservation is in its infancy, it is hard to project how long cryopreserved samples can be held without damage. Some reports estimate 10,000 years before enough background radiation has accumulated to cause enough damage to the DNA of the sample by random events.

## Capabilities

The technical focus areas of the Fish Technology Center continue to expand, especially in cryopreservation applied research.  Areas of specialty now include technical support for fisheries resource programs such as interjurisdictional fishes, estuarine and riverine fishes, non-indigenous aquatic nuisance species, threatened and endangered species, and other emerging high priority aquatic resource needs.

Cryopreservation Lab staff focus on these areas:

1. Development of new protocols
1. Archiving endangered species diversity
1. Enhancing hatchery spawning capabilities.

## Applied Cryogenics for Fish and Fisheries Programs

Collection, storage, and cryopreservation of sperm provides a management tool for conserving genetic resources to enhance fisheries programs and reverse the population decline of threatened and endangered fishes.

These techniques enable:

- transport of semen over long distances;
- long-term storage for emergency situations (in the event of a catastrophic event);
- spawning of asynchronous populations;
- better control of selective breeding;
- the use of frozen sperm for out-breeding of spawning populations from year to year;
- preservation of genetic materials in a gene management (diversity enhancing) program;
- preservation of genetic stocks;
- increasing genetic diversity;
- transfer of genes from wild populations to hatchery broodstock;
- transfer of genetic material between wild populations.

We provide management support of interjurisdictional coastal and riverine fishes such as:

- White sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*)
- Shortnose sturgeon (*Acipenser brevirostrum*)
- Lake sturgeon (*Acipenser fulvescens*)
- Green sturgeon (*Acipenser medirostris*)
- Atlantic sturgeon (*Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus*)
- American shad (*Alosa sapidissima*)
- Alligator gar (*Atractosteus spatula*)
- Bonytail chub (*Gila elegans*)
- Striped bass (*Morone saxilitis*)
- Robust redhorse (*Moxostoma robustum*)
- Sicklefin redhorse (*Moxostoma sp.*)
- Cutthroat trout (*Oncorhynchus clarkii*)
- Gila trout (*Oncorhynchus gilae*)
- Apache trout (*Oncorhynchus gilae apache*)
- Rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*)
- Kokanee salmon (*Oncorhynchus nerka*)
- Paddlefish (*Polyodon spathula*)
- Brown trout (*Salmo trutta*)
- Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*)
- Brook trout (*Salvelinus fontinalis*)
- Pallid sturgeon (*Scaphirhynchus albus*)
- Shovelnose sturgeon (*Scaphirhynchus platorynchus*)
- Alabama sturgeon (*Scaphirhyncus suttkusi*)
- Red drum (*Sciaenops ocellatus*)
- Walleye (*Stizostedion vitreum*)
- Freshwater mussels – various species
