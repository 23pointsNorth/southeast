On Sept. 11, 2019, [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](/wolf-creek) and its Friends Group hosted the eighth annual Wounded Warrior Fishing Event. Typically, five or six fishing guides volunteer their services to take 25 wounded veterans out for a morning of striped bass fishing on Lake Cumberland. Seven guides volunteered this year, allowing the staff to offer an additional five spots on the voyage.

With the warm lake temperatures, low oxygen this time of year, and lack of rain, even the stripers were showing signs of stress and werenâ€™t biting often. Nevertheless, the participants enjoyed the trip, sharing stories and homemade pumpkin rolls made by a spouse of one of the guides.

Following the lake trip, participants met back at the hatchery for a group photo before heading down to the pavilion for the honorary salute and lunch. The salute was provided by the local Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6097, Disabled American Veterans  Chapter 51, and Disabled American Veterans Auxiliary  Chapter 51. A local restaurant catered a fried fish lunch.

After lunch, handmade cards from local elementary students were distributed to each participant. In addition to trout fishing on Hatchery Creek in the afternoon, the participants and their families were offered a tour of the Wolf Creek Dam and Powerhouse, courtesy of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

With the continued support of volunteers and sponsors, Wolf Creek NFH and the Friends of Wolf Creek NFH, Inc. look forward to hosting this event for years to come.
