Natchitoches National Fish Hatchery had the luxury of having several amazing volunteers recently donate their time at our facility:  Bonnie Stevens, Sharon Hucks, Aaron Ruud, Cindy Wright, and Macey Canerday.

During their time at the hatchery, they coordinated and executed several community outreach events, including bringing in the local high school art students to paint a hatchery- themed mural in the entrance area of the aquarium.

Other activities included providing tours and organizing and planning events.  They also organized equipment in the hatchery buildings and helped with equipment maintenance, grounds-keeping, and feeding fish.   The volunteers freed up time for  staff to focus on aquaculture-based projects and have boosted accomplishments in a short period of time. 

We are truly grateful for their time and efforts at our facility, and we also have created lasting friendships with them.
