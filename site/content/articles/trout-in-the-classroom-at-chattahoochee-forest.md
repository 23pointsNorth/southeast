Project Leader and Fishery Biologist Kelly Taylor spent Jan. 6, 2020, teaching 7th grade science students from Union County Middle School about trout at Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery. In the outreach program’s third year, teacher Jacquie Tallman and Taylor developed curriculum to help students better understand trout by helping them raise live trout. Trout in the Classroom was sponsored by the local Trout Unlimited Chapter Chattahoochee/Nantahala #692. The Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery provided 31 fingerlings to the project.

Taylor talked with students about trout fishing in North Georgia streams and shared information about the hatchery’s annual fishing rodeos.
