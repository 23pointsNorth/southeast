[Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/) is a veterans service organization that uses disaster response to help reintegrate veterans back into civilian life. Veteran-founded, this international service organization employs leadership and organizational skills to assist communities with disaster response and recovery.

At [Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/florida_panther/), Project Leader Kevin Godsea recognized a partnership opportunity when David Venables of Team Rubicon called him to ask if he could partner with the refuge for field training. Venables  had been working in nearby Immokalee, Florida, to help the community with [Hurricane Irma](/tags/hurricane-irma) restoration. Through this involvement, he knew of a small cadre of veterans needing heavy equipment training to facilitate their Team Rubicon volunteerism and continued disaster response efforts. Venables was also able to suggest a Service equipment instructor who could provide the training. He just needed some equipment and a location.

Godsea and his staff were in the process of their own Irma restoration, which included tearing down and rebuilding a damaged pole barn. He offered a second day of Rubicon training to help with the project. That solidified a partnership, and an early September date was set.

Team Rubicon contacted their heavy equipment partner Case International to deliver some items for the pole barn teardown. Service Equipment Operator Aaron Eaton flew in to provide instruction to four veterans. The six-person team of instructors and veterans tore down the 190-foot pole barn in one day. This involved breaking down and placing the barn debris in waste disposal dumpsters using heavy equipment.

The group was so efficient that they had time during their second day for a swamp buggy tour, led by Wildlife Refuge Specialist Jessica Sutt.  The four vets were impressed by the buggy, the refuge, and informative tour. They walked off the refuge with exclamations of “What a great day!”
