On the second Saturday of each month, Kentucky’s [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek) hosts a fly-fishing clinic that addresses an aspect of fly-fishing. In October, Rob Worthing of Tenkara Guides gave a presentation on the tenkara technique. Tenkara is an ancient Japanese fly-fishing method involving a rod, line, and single fly. The class provided hands-on instruction, with 15 participants learning how to rig, cast, catch and land fish with fixed line rods. It was a beautiful day for practicing casts on the lawn, for learning to steer the fish, and for tracing the fly in Hatchery Creek. 
  
Environmental education specialist Moria Painter has worked with local fly-fishing experts to offer this series of fly-fishing clinics throughout 2017. The next sessions, in November and December, will cover fly tying. These clinics are popular, drawing 15-30 participants each time, with some visitors traveling over three hours to attend. The popularity of these clinics is no surprise, given that fly-fishing is an ever-growing sport around the world, with Kentucky set to become a leading state in the sport.
 
With the recent addition of the catch and release section of Wolf Creek NFH’s Hatchery Creek, fly-fishing enthusiasts have a trout mecca. Hatchery Creek is a completely manmade stream designed with trout in mind. The creek provides habitat for each stage of the trout life cycle and includes a fish ladder connecting it to the Cumberland River, a trophy trout water in Kentucky.
