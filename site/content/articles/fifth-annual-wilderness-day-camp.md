The [Friends of Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery](https://www.facebook.com/Friends-of-Dale-Hollow-NFH-278069702269466/) hosted the fifth annual Wilderness Day Camp on July 13.  The event was co-sponsored by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Tennessee State Parks, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Activity stations included BB-gun and archery target shooting, water safety, a live barred owl, a dog care and handling demonstration, and fly rod casting.  Eighty children and 30 adults attended the event at the Corpsâ€™ picnic shelter at the Dale Hollow Dam site.  Thanks to everyone who helped make this event such a success.
