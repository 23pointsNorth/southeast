[Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek) and the Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery hosted a Holiday Open House that drew more than 200 people to the hatchery on a chilly December day.  

Guests were greeted with the sounds of Christmas provided by the Lake Cumberland Community Orchestra.  The four-hour event included a Letter-to-Santa station; holiday refreshments; free gift wrapping of purchases from the Friends Group gift shop; guided hatchery tours; and the highlight, making several unique nature-themed ornaments.  The festivities concluded with a special tree lighting of the Visitor Center tree adorned with the handmade ornaments from visitors.

Friends Group President Shevawn Foley was in awe of the beautiful ornaments that were crafted using salvaged driftwood, sea glass, and a little creativity. As visitors, volunteers, and staff gathered around, she led the countdown to  the tree lighting.  The families attending  enjoyed the event.

"We hope to make this an annual Christmas tradition for the community,” said Foley. “Kayla (Friends Group secretary), Moria, and I have some wonderful ideas to make it even bigger and more festive next year.”
