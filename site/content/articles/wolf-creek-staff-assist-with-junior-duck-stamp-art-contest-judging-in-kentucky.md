In March, Wolf Creek administrative assistant Teresa Devore and environmental education and outreach specialist Ashley Buffington, travelled to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resource Salato Center in Frankfort to assist in the judging process of the 2017 Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest in Kentucky. 

This contest is the culminating activity for the Junior Duck Stamp educational program. After studying waterfowl anatomy and habitat through this educational program, students may express their knowledge by drawing, painting or sketching an eligible North American waterfowl species and submitting it to the Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest for a chance to be selected as the next Junior Duck Stamp.

In each of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several U.S. territories, panels of five judges review the artwork and select the Best of Show. The Best of Show from each competition then is sent to the Federal Junior Duck Stamp Design Contest, where a panel of judges selects one image to become the next Junior Duck Stamp.

More than 800 entries were submitted in the state of Kentucky. The judges were  Nate Beckman, Environmental Scientist III, LG&E and KU; Martina Hines, Natural Heritage Branch Manager, Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission; John Brunjes, Migratory Bird Program Coordinator, Kentucky Dept. of Fish and Wildlife Resources; Sue Brunderman, retired biologist, artist; and Michael Pendley, freelance writer, Realtreeâ€™s Timber 2 Table blogger. After much deliberation, the panel selected the Best of Show artwork, submitted by William Seay, a 14-year-old from St. Mary Middle and High School in Paducah, Kentucky.
