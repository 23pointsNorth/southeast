In March, Wolf Creek administrative assistant Teresa Devore and environmental education and outreach specialist Ashley Buffington, travelled to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resource Salato Center in Frankfort to assist in the judging process of the 2017 Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest in Kentucky. 

This contest is the culminating activity for the Junior Duck Stamp educational program. After studying waterfowl anatomy and habitat through this educational program, students may express their knowledge by drawing, painting or sketching an eligible North American waterfowl species and submitting it to the Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest for a chance to be selected as the next Junior Duck Stamp.

In each of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several U.S. territories, panels of five judges review the artwork and select the Best of Show. The Best of Show from each competition then is sent to the Federal Junior Duck Stamp Design Contest, where a panel of judges selects one image to become the next Junior Duck Stamp.

More than 800 entries were submitted in the state of Kentucky. The judges were  Nate Beckman, Environmental Scientist III, LG&E and KU; Martina Hines, Natural Heritage Branch Manager, Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission; John Brunjes, Migratory Bird Program Coordinator, Kentucky Dept. of Fish and Wildlife Resources; Sue Brunderman, retired biologist, artist; and Michael Pendley, freelance writer, Realtree’s Timber 2 Table blogger. After much deliberation, the panel selected the Best of Show artwork, submitted by a 14-year-old from St. Mary Middle and High School in Paducah.

On Saturday, June 3rd, Wolf Creek NFH and the Friends of Wolf Creek NFH held the 31st Annual Catch A Rainbow Kids’ Fishing Derby. Created to promote outdoor activity in children, this event has grown since its inception in 1986. Each year this event coincides with The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources’ Free Fishing Weekend, which offers residents and non-residents the opportunity to fish Kentucky waters without a license or permit. This allows for a fun-filled fishing weekend for the whole family, with little-to-no associated cost for participants. 

This year, with over 1,250 children in participation, and more than 3,000 people total, the event was another one for the books. All attendees were provided with unlimited complimentary hotdogs, chips, drinks, and snow cones. In addition to fishing at the creek, children were afforded the opportunity to practice their archery skills with Ducks Unlimited, to hone their casting skills with the Friends Group, to meet up with Smokey Bear for a photo-op, and to have their face painted. Each participant took home a goodie bag of items, including a reusable Friends of Wolf Creek NFH, Inc. water bottle, and many even won prizes such as fishing poles, sleeping bags, tackle boxes, and tents.  

As an added bonus, special guests Allan Brown, Assistant Regional Director, and Steve Jackson, Deputy Assistant Regional Director, joined us from the Regional Office in Atlanta, GA. Both Brown and Jackson witnessed and experienced the joy brought forth by this special event. 

Support and planning for this event came about through generous donations of more than a hundred volunteers and over one hundred sponsors. Thank you to everyone who assisted with making this event successful. Wolf Creek NFH and the Friends of Wolf Creek NFH look forward to hosting this event for years to come.
