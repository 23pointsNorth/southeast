Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery near Suches, Georgia, hosted a Seniors Fishing Rodeo for adults aged 55 and older on June 2 and a Family Fishing Festival for youth aged 16 and under on June 3. Both of the events drew large crowds. 

Rock Creek was stocked with about 3,000 beautiful rainbow trout each day. Free hot dog lunches were provided to participants courtesy of Friends of the Hatchery with help from Trout Unlimited, Save-A-Lot, Coca Cola, and Pepsi Cola. Free fishing rods and reels were given away as prizes courtesy of Friends of the Hatchery.

During the Family Fishing Day, families enjoyed visiting environmental education exhibit booths and participating in a scavenger hunt. Exhibitors included Georgia Department of Natural Resources; Georgia Forestry Commission; Friends of the Hatchery; Trout Unlimited; X-Treme Christian Outdoors; North Georgia Taxidermy; Complete Cash; and Face Painting by Carol & Sig. 

More than 40 hard-working volunteers assisted with event set-up, clean-up and other tasks associated with the double days. These additional volunteers were members of other chapters of Trout Unlimited including Foothills Clarkesville #629 and Gold Rush Dahlonega #733; Fannin Countyâ€™s Larry Clemmons; the Appalachian Judicial Court System; House of Prayer Blairsville; and the First Baptist Church of Blairsville.
