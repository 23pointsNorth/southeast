This spring, 67 Barrens topminnows were released into Short Springs located near Tullahoma, Tennessee. These Barrens topminnows were spawned at Conservation Fisheries Inc. (CFI). The Tennessee Aquarium and CFI provide [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](/wolf-creek) with the topminnows when they reach about 10-12 millimeters in length for grow-out. Cultured fish are released at about 25 millimeters, and Wolf Creek typically makes one or two releases during the year.

The program is coordinated with the [Cookeville, Tennessee, Ecological Services Field Office](https://www.fws.gov/cookeville).

As with many other species, spring is spawning season for the topminnows, and releases are normally in the spring in order to optimize spawning potential.  Before the topminnows were released into Short Springs they were acclimated to the temperature of the Springs before they were released.  This helps to prevent shocks to the fish because the temperature in the bag could be different from the water temperature in the Springs.
