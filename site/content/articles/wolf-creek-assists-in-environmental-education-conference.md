The 42nd annual Kentucky Association for Environmental Education conference was held in early September.  Environmental education specialists Moria Painter and Ashley Buffington attended the conference and staffed a booth that provided information on the national fish hatchery system and the biologist-in-training program.  Painter was joined by Randy Robinson from the National Conservation Training Center to give information to 23 educators about the  online toolkit Conservation Connect.
