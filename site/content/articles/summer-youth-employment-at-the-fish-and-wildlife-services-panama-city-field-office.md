The [Panama City Field Office](https://www.fws.gov/panamacity) welcomes two local teenagers, Hope Barras and Joshua Cumbie, who will take part in the 2018 Youth Conservation Corps (YCC).  This is a federally funded youth employment program facilitated by the Department of Interior.  Hope and Joshua both attend Mosley High School and are leaders in the Marine Corps Junior ROTC program.  Hope is a member of the weightlifting team and plans to attend Florida State University and become a large animal veterinarian.   Joshua will attend Gulf Coast State College, on a full-scholarship, major in Biology and hopes to become a Naval officer.  They will work side by side with biologists researching various species such as gulf sturgeon, gopher tortoises, various reptiles and sea turtles.  The summer YCC Program begins in early June and concludes in August.
