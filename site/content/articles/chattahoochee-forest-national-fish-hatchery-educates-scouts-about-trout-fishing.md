On Nov., 2019, Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery program assistant Crystal Thomas and volunteer Mike Morton staffed a booth about trout fishing during the 2019 Hornaday Weekend-Atlanta Area Council at the Woodruff Scout Camp in North Georgia. Hundreds of scouts from all over the southeastern United States visited the hatchery booth seeking information about trout fishing, ethics and conservation. Some were seasoned at fishing while others were seeking a first-time experience. Many were eager to hit the North Georgia trout waters as soon as possible after learning more. The hatchery also served as a scout project advocate for opportunities leading to earning merit badges.
