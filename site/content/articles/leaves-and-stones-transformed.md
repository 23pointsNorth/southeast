Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and the Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery is hosting four nature-inspired craft workshops in 2018.  The first was held on September 22, with 18 participants creating their own unique jewelry.  Each participant took home at least four gift quality jewelry items.

The series will continue on October 13, with wreath-making. November 10 will focus on spa essentials, and on December 8 the series will conclude with holiday ornaments and a Friends of Wolf Creek Open House with refreshments.  Crafts utilize natural, reclaimed, and recycled items, such as wood, stone, clay and other plant materials.  Each class is designed to bring out the creativity in people and to help them see the beauty in the natural world around them.  A leaf or stone can be transformed into something that can be treasured for years to come.
