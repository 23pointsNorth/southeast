U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees stationed in Kentucky met for the annual All Employee Meeting on February 22, at Mammoth Cave National Park in Cave City, Kentucky.  Originally, this meeting was to be hosted at the Ecological Services office in Frankfort. Instead, the Ecological Services staff hosted the meeting at a more centralized location.  

Representatives from the Ecological Services office, Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge, law enforcement, and Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery provided updates for each field station and reported new employees and recent retirements. 

After the meeting, attendees travelled to the site of the recent dam breach at Lock and Dam Number 6 on the Green River to see it for themselves  and bring awareness to the issue.   The Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Park Service and other organizations are collaborating on removing the dam.
