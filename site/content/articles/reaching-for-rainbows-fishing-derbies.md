On Sept. 27- 28, 2017, Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery in Kentucky hosted its annual Reaching for Rainbows Special Needs Kids’ Fishing Derbies for four local county school districts. These annual events were established to allow children with moderate to severe developmental and intellectual challenges the opportunity to connect with nature. This year marked the 10th anniversary of the event’s beginnings with  Russell and Clinton County school districts, and the third anniversary for Adair and Cumberland county school districts.

Thirty-five children from Adair and Cumberland counties participated on Wednesday, and 75 children from Russell and Clinton counties participated on Thursday. Both days were filled with big smiles and squeals of excitement as the children reeled in their catches at Hatchery Creek. About 25 experienced anglers volunteered their time and expertise to assist the children in fishing. State and local conservation agencies provided other activities, such as photo opportunities with Smokey Bear and face painting. Participants also enjoyed a complimentary lunch, and received an event t-shirt and medallion. Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery thanks everyone who helped execute these events for these well-deserving kids.
