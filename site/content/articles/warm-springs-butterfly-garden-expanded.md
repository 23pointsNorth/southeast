Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery in Georgia  continues to add to its butterfly garden with the expertise of hatchery manager Carlos Echevarria, who has brought the love of his lifelong hobby to the hatchery garden.

With the addition of 83 new plants and 14 different species to the current  32 butterfly milkweeds, the garden will support all types of pollinators and will be a magnificent sight for all to enjoy. This ongoing pollinator restoration program will further help to recover endangered and threatened pollinators such as the the monarch butterfly.

In addition to the expanded butterfly garden, one acre of land nearby  has been sowed with wildflower seeds that will be a beautiful addition for all to enjoy.
