On Nov. 29, 2017, Fannin County High School Agriculture Class students visited Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery in Georgia.   Project leader Kelly Taylor and program assistant Crystal Thomas provided a tour of the hatchery grounds. Taylor spoke with students about hatchery operations, stocking, volunteering and careers with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  He encouraged interested students to apply for Youth Conservation Corps positions offered during the summer and explained that the program provides good experience for those aiming for an education and career in working with the Service. The high school is one of many groups that schedule field trips to the hatchery each year.
