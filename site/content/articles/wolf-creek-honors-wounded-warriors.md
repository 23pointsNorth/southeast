On September 11, [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek/) in Kentucky hosted its sixth annual Wounded Warriors Fishing Event for veterans who sustained injuries during their service. Twenty veterans participated in a guided striped bass trip on Lake Cumberland just after sunrise. the Russell County Honor Guard conducted a special ceremony to honor and remember our service personnel  for their sacrifice. Participants were then treated to a catered barbecue lunch. Many participants tried their hands at fly fishing at Hatchery Creek after their meals. It was an honor to host this event for these well-deserving veterans.
