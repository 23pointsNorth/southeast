Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and the Friends of Wolf Creek hosted the 11th annual Catch a Smile Senior Fishing Derby on September 25, for anyone 62 years of age or older. More than 140 participants joined us for this event.  Most participants were able to catch at least one fish during the three hour time-period, with many catching their limit within the first hour. A complimentary lunch was provided for all participants and their accompanying families. Outdoor related door prizes such as camp stoves, chairs, fishing rods and reels, and gardening tools were given away after lunch.

Thank you to all the sponsors, volunteers, Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery staff members and Friends group officers for helping ensure another successful Catch a Smile Senior Fishing Derby.
