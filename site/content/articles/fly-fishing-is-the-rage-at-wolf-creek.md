Wolf Creek hosted a two-day, intensive Fly Fishing Conclave in mid-August. Twenty-eight eager anglers were immersed in learning from some of the best fly fishing experts in Kentucky.  The conclave began with a presentation from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineersâ€™ Wolf Creek Powerhouse Superintendent on the flow of the Cumberland River.  Other topics included basic gear and rigging, casting, entomology for the fly Angler, reading the water, nymphing, fishing with dry flies and streamers, tenkar and fly tying, and a question and answer town hall talk.  Feedback from this event was positive, and more programs on fly fishing are slated for 2019.
