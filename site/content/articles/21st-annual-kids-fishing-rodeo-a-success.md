On June 9,  a total of 2,000 nine inch rainbow and 10 large display rainbow trout and brook trout were released in the creek below the Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery in Celina, Tennessee, for the 21st annual Kids’ Fishing Rodeo.  Held in celebration of National Fishing and Boating Week, the Rodeo is open to young people 15 and under.

This event is co-sponsored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Friends of Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery, Friends of Dale Hollow Lake, and the citizens of Clay County, Tennessee. The Friends of Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery distributed free hot dogs.  Clay County Sheriff Brandon Boone was master of ceremonies with assistance from Celina Police Officer Megan Copas.  Clay County Emergency Medical Service also assisted with the event.

Participants registered for random prize drawings which took place throughout the morning.  One of the highlights of this year’s event was the unveiling of the Junior Ranger Angler program.  Expert face painter Leigh Shaull was kept busy all morning.  Nine staff members from participating agencies, seven volunteers, and six Friends Group members worked together to make this event a huge success.

This year’s event drew a good crowd of 220 children and approximately 175 adults.  People from as far away as Florida, Wisconsin, and Ohio, made the trip to Celina to get the chance to catch a rainbow trout.
