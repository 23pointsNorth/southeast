John Cooper, a [Student Temporary Employment Program](http://www.fws.gov/southeast/work-with-us/internships/) participant, attended his fire training while working at [St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge](http://www.fws.gov/refuge/st_marks/) this summer. He took the beginners wildland fire courses, S-130 Beginning Wildland Fire Operations, S-190 Beginning Fire Weather and Behavior and L-180 Human Factors on the Fireline. After passing these courses, he took the Wildland Fire Arduous Capacity Test, which is walking quickly for three miles carrying an extra 45 pounds of weight in a backpack in under 45 minutes.

John's first prescribed fire was on [St. Vincent National Wildlife Refuge](http://www.fws.gov/refuge/st_vincent/) in the Tahiti Beach/Dry Bar area. The prescribed fire was aerially ignited by a helicopter for a total of 2,834 acres. The prescribed fire was burned to reduce fuel loads and give the Scott's Seaside Sparrow better nesting areas in the marsh.

As luck would have it, on the drive home from the prescribed fire on St. Vincent National Wildlife Refuge, the Apalachicola National Forest requested assistance for a wildfire. John went to his first wildfire called the Thousand Fire. The Thousand Fire was 43 acres.

John returns to college in mid-August with lots of good field experience.
