Crisp autumn weather is the perfect setting for a day spent learning about Environmental Education in the great outdoors. For 229 fourth graders from Russell County Elementary schools enjoyed the annual Outdoor Eco Day hosted by Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery (NFH) and the Friends of Wolf Creek NFH, Inc. on October 25.

Students arrived by bus in the early morning hours, departing the bus at the visitor center and traveling by foot to nine different stations located on hatchery grounds.  Each class spent about 20 minutes at each station learning from subject experts.

Partners for this year’s program included Kentucky State Parks with a close look at the reptile world, the University of Kentucky Extension presented “Edible Compost”, Kentucky Division of Forestry discussed forest safety, Mammoth Cave National Park got the kids active with a human aqueduct relay, and Wolf Creek NFH gave a hatchery tour.  In addition, Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge presented “Hidden Hazards”, Kentucky Division of Air Quality presented Lung Defenders, the US Army Corps of Engineers discussed water safety in a fun, interactive way and the Kentucky Division of Water got wet and muddy with Wacky, Wild Wetland!

This continued a long-standing tradition to host the local fourth grade students for a day of hands-on lessons that help enhance key science standards.  Students and teachers alike look forward to this day all year long. Each of the nine teachers were presented with a goodie bag full of fish posters, Natural Inquirer Science journals and many other fun, educational items.
