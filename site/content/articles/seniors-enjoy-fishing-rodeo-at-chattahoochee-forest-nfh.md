Dark skies and occasional heavy rains did not stop die-hard anglers from attending the Seniors Fishing Rodeo at  Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery June 7; more than 150 anglers ages 55 to 90 years old attended. Rock Creek was stocked with beautiful rainbow and brook trout each day, including some fish weighing as much as 4 pounds. A free hotdog lunch was provided to participants courtesy of Friends of the Hatchery, Trout Unlimited of Blue Ridge #696 and Blairsville #692, Save-A-Lot Blue Ridge, Coca Cola, and Pepsi Cola. Fishing rods and reels were given away courtesy of Friends of the Hatchery and Blairsville Trout Unlimited #692.
