Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee Refuge volunteer Dennis Kendrick spent 309 hours building an outdoor kiosk at the refugeâ€™s north entrance.  During his stay in Mississippi, Dennis also helped with several other tasks including mending a broken levee, maintaining roads, and drawing up several plans for upcoming refuge projects.  He and his wife Jean are now exploring Louisiana and its many refuge volunteer opportunities.
