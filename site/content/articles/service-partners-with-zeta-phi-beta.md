The Fish and Wildlife Service entered into a nationally recognized partnership with [Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.](http://zphib1920.org/) – one of the nation’s largest and most influential African American organizations. This relationship supports the Service’s [Urban Wildlife Refuge Program](https://www.fws.gov/urban/) which provides opportunities for non-traditional audiences to learn about and enjoy natural areas and public lands around them. This partnership also sparked the creation of Zeta Phi Beta’s Pearls in the Wild initiative which introduces youth to the value of natural resources and nurtures the next generation of conservationists.

On Saturday, May 20, 2017, more than 60 members of the Belle Glade, Palm Beach, and Broward, Florida chapters of Zeta Phi Beta visited the [Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ARM_Loxahatchee/) during Zeta Days weekend when sorority members from across the nation visited their local National Wildlife Refuges. Through great collaboration, Loxahatchee Public Use staff members and volunteers provided a fun and engaging day that included information about the importance of the Everglades ecosystem to biodiversity and its impact on our daily lives, interpretive hikes, nature scavenger hunts, archery, and craft projects.

It was an honor and a pleasure for the refuge to host such a prominent organization in the African American community. Initiatives from both the Service and Zeta Phi Beta, Inc. hope to further advance this partnership and ensure that conservation and learning opportunities are available.
