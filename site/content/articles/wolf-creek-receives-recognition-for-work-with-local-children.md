On Oct. 23, [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek) staff members and volunteers from Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery attended  the monthly Russell County Board of Education meeting for a special recognition ceremony. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Wolf Creekâ€™s Reaching for Rainbows fishing derby for local children with moderate to severe physical and intellectual disabilities.

This recognition acknowledged the decade of fishing derbies offered by Wolf Creek and its Friends group, which provide hands-on, fun-filled fishing experiences for the children of the local community. Wolf Creek is honored to receive this recognition and looks forward to offering these fishing opportunities for years to come.
