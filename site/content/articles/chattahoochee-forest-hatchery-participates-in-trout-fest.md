Project Leader Kelly Taylor and staff represented Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery at the second annual Trout Fest on April 29, 2017, at Blue Ridge in Fannin County, the Trout Capital of Georgia. The event drew thousands of visitors and showcased dozens of environmentally oriented agencies, organizations and vendors.  Hatchery booth visitors were interested in trout fishing and stocking programs and eager to learn about the environment and good stewardship techniques to protect and conserve the trout waters in north Georgia. It was the perfect opportunity for the hatchery to reach out and educate thousands of people in one day! For more information about Trout Fest, visit http://blueridgetroutfest.com.
