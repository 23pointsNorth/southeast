Thanks to more than 60 volunteers, students from north Georgia area schools and adults were able to enjoy a great day of fishing at Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery on May 8, 2019. The Special Kids Fishing Rodeo is pre-arranged annually for students and adults with disabilities, many of which are confined to wheelchairs. Generations of dedicated volunteers provide one-on-one fishing assistance for each participant. One teacher said, “My students look forward to this experience each year. For many of them, this is the only opportunity they have to fish.” A parent said, “The volunteers are great! This is the only time my child gets to fish. I could not do this without the volunteer help.” An adult participant asks each year, “When can we fish again?” And, the volunteers return each year. It’s an experience that keeps us all hooked on fishing!
