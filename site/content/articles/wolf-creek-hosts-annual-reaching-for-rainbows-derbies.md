Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and the Friends of Wolf Creek hosted two annual fishing events for moderately to severely disabled students: the fourth annual Reaching for Rainbows Kids Fishing Derbies for Adair and Cumberland Counties; and the 11th annual Reaching for Rainbows Kids Fishing Derby for Russell and Clinton Counties.

For the first time in 11 years, the Reaching for Rainbows Kids Fishing Derbies were rescheduled due to weather concerns with separate events for Adair and Cumberland counties. The Fourth Annual Reaching for Rainbows Kids Fishing Derby was held as scheduled on September 27, 2018 for the special education students enrolled in Adair County Schools. Seventeen kids, ranging from 5 to 18 years old, participated. Due to uncooperative weather, an educational program was provided to kick off the event. The weather improved enough for trout fishing at Hatchery Creek in the afternoon. Each participant received a complimentary event t-shirt and special medallion.

The Rainbows Kids Fishing Derby for Cumberland County was held on October 10. Ten children participated in the event. They fished for trout in Hatchery Creek; met Goldie; received an event t-shirt and medallion; and enjoyed a complimentary lunch.  The kids also explored the Visitor Center, hatchery, and raceways, and met Benny, the corn snake.

The derby for the special needs students from Russell and Clinton County Schools was held on September 28. Sixty-five students were treated to a beautiful day of trout fishing on Hatchery Creek, along with a delicious hamburger and hot dog cookout. Almost every student caught their limit of rainbow trout, and they left the event with big smiles, full bellies, and a commemorative t-shirt and medallion.

Thank you to all the sponsors, volunteers, the Wolf Creek staff, and Friends group officers for helping ensure another successful year of fall fishing events.
