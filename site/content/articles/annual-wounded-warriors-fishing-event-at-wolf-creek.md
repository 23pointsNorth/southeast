[Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek) and the [Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.friendsofwolfcreeknfh.com/) hosted the seventh annual Wounded Warriors Fishing Event on September 11, 2018, for 20 American servicemen and servicewomen.  The event began at 5:30 a.m.  Participants received t-shirts, breakfast, and snacks before departing to Lake Cumberland for a morning of striped bass fishing.  During the afternoon, the veterans enjoyed a catered barbeque lunch, a21-gun-salute  provided by the local Disabled American Veterans, and a goody bag from the Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery.  Later, everyone went trout fishing at Hatchery Creek.  Some veterans were given a class in fly fishing led by Wolf Creek volunteer Mark Lamberth.  This event is always a huge success, and the participants, staff members, and volunteers leave with renewed spirits.
