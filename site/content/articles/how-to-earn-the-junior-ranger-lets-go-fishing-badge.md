On June 14, 2018, dozens of students visited Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery in Suches, Georgia, as part of a local public school summer program. Project Leader Kelly Taylor and Program Assistant Crystal Thomas gave tours through the hatchery building and raceways as they talked with students, teachers, and parents about the life cycle of a trout, hatchery operations, and stocking. Tours included seeing a stocking truck and watching staff members feed fish. Students learned about trout fishing, conservation, and good stewardship. Each student received a Junior Ranger Let’s Go Fishing! Activity Book and was encouraged to complete the book with their parents and bring it back to the hatchery to receive their badge.
