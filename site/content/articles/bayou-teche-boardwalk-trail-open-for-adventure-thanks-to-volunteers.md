As the cypress and tupelo trees along the bayou began to turn their fall yellow and russet colors, an AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) team arrived in Southeast Louisiana.  This traveling crew of eight young adults, aged 18 to 25, were excited to gain leadership and job skills while making a difference at Bayou Teche refuge. Their stewardship mission for three weeks was to repair an interpretive boardwalk that winds through a wetland area.

The NCCC team deconstructed decayed parts of the boardwalk and then reconstructed and renovated the structure. The newly repaired boardwalk trail provides the public with a scenic, elevated, and dry bayou experience.

“These hard-working individuals were a pleasure to work with. This great group of young people helped complete a project that would otherwise have taken me many weeks to finish,” said Brian Pember, assistant refuge manager of [Bayou Teche National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bayou_teche/).  “The team was happy to assist wherever needed, also doing service work for Habitat for Humanity and the Good Samaritan Food Bank in the community of Houma, Louisiana.”

Thanks to this group’s effort, the Garden City boardwalk at Bayou Teche was ready for the public to enjoy during the nice fall and winter weather. The NCCC crew’s next stop was Florida, where they helped residents clean up after Hurricane Michael.  A hearty thank you to all the fantastic AmeriCorps members who make such a difference for communities and refuges across the nation!
