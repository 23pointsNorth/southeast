_Show airs 8 p.m. Feb. 12_

Florida is well-known for its beaches and year-round sun, but it is also home to a wild side, with pine forests, coral reefs, manatees, and the Everglades, the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States.

Every year, this state faces the full forces of nature: from wildfires to flooding to powerful hurricanes. Now, a growing human population, rising sea levels and abandoned exotic pets, like the Burmese python, are added threats to this wild paradise.

A new PBS documentary tells the story of how Florida’s ecosystems continue to weather these storms with the help of pioneering scientists and ongoing conservation efforts. “PBS Nature: Wild Florida” airs at 8 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2020, on most PBS member stations, including those in the Georgia Public Television network.

The documentary includes a segment shot with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) at the Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve. TNC’s North Florida Program Manager David Printiss discusses the longleaf pine ecosystem, wildlife, and the importance of prescribed fire.
