If you had asked recovery biologists 10 years ago to list the best places to return mussels to the wild, Gills Creek would have been at the very bottom of that list.  The small South Carolina stream had been through a lot. Too much, it seemed, to recover.  Situated  just south of Charlotte, North Carolina, and east of Lancaster, South Carolina, the watershed had seen the advance of suburban sprawl, and was battling ongoing agricultural degradation.

However, a couple of things were in its favor.  Gills Creek was federally designated as critical habitat for the endangered [Carolina heelsplitter](/wildlife/mussels/carolina-heelsplitter/) in 2002, and the species was miraculously found there as late as 2013.  These factors led a multi-agency team to begin emergency restoration efforts.  Over the past five years, three road crossings have been replaced by the Southeastâ€™s Aquatic Habitat Restoration Team, opening up miles of critical habitat to fish passage for the first time in over a decade.  The final replacement came in 2017, as well as the first augmentation of Carolina heelsplitters, using mussels produced at Orangeburg National Fish Hatchery.

Recent survey efforts indicate these heelsplitters are still present in the system after two years.  They are also growing quickly, putting on about a millimeter of shell growth per month, and nearly doubling in size.  Against all odds, Gills Creek is healing, building its capacity to support an endangered mussel species.  It is no longer at the bottom of any list.
