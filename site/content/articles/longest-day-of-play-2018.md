Kids love to have fun outside in the summer but sometimes the lure of electronics is more appealing.  The Longest Day of Play event at [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek) is designed to spark the imagination of the participants and give them hands-on games and activities to do at home.  This event, co-sponsored by the local Russell County Health Coalition and its partners, attracted more than 325 participants from the local community, three summer school groups, and a nursing home summer day camp.

Each June, the hatchery joins our partners in celebrating the Longest Day of Play, a day set aside to celebrate the longest day of the year.  The goal is to encourage physical and outdoor activity among children and families within the community and surrounding areas.
 
Booths were set up with interactive games and free giveaways, including sunglasses, water bottles, sports balls, sunblock and other outdoor-related items. Participants also had access to archery, casting, Fishy Fun relay games and a story trail walk sponsored by the local library.  Kentucky State Parks, Lake Cumberland District Health Department, Kentucky Division of Water, Russell County Library, and numerous other local organizations all work together to make the event a success.  The reward at the end of a long, hot June day is the memory of the many smiling faces who participated in the Longest Day of Play.
