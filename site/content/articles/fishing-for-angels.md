Saturday, Aug. 25, marked the date of the Fishing for Angels Fifth Annual Bass Classic. When I heard about this event, I offered to volunteer for it.

The event benefits Holy Angels, a residential campus for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Holy Angels has more than 180 residents on site. Some of these residents were able to join the fun at the Red River South Marina in northwest Louisiana. Joe Stephens, founder of the annual fishing tournament, originated the idea.

This event had many activities, including  kid’s games, an all you can eat food buffet, face painting, a coloring section, and more. I set up a booth for the [Red River National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/red_river/) in the family fun center. Children of the fishing event participants and Holy Angels residents thoroughly enjoyed visiting the refuge booth.  At our booth, everyone’s favorite activity was the wooden fishing game.  One fisherman's son spent about an hour catching, releasing, and recapturing the small magnetic fish.

After all that play-fishing excitement it was time to pack up and go.
