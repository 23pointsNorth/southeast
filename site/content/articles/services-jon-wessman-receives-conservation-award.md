The award recognizes Wessman’s  contributions and commitment to the management, enhancement and restoration of wildlife resources during his 16-year career in Arkansas.

Wessmam helped develop the first Forest Land Compatible Use Guidelines used by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to guide delivery of farm bill programs.  As the lead for red-cockaded woodpecker recovery activities with the USFWS Arkansas Ecological Services Field Office, he administered Habitat Conservation Agreements with industrial timber interests to promote woodpecker populations on Arkansas working lands.  

In his current capacity as a private lands biologist, Wessman  works to integrate priority migratory bird conservation objectives with the delivery of habitat conservation projects under the Service’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife program and Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Farm Bill Programs.
