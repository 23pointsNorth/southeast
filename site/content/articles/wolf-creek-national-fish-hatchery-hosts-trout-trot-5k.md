More than 100 participants gathered at [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek/) on April 14, to experience the third Annual Trout Trot 5K.  Even in the rain, these dedicated runners had a great time. Participants came from as far as Florida to join in the hatchery run along picturesque Hatchery Creek.  Participants comment that the race course is one of the best in Kentucky.  

Moria Painter attributes the continued success of this event to many race sponsors including, Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery, Russell County Health Coalition, Stantec, Ridgewater, Eco Grow, and Sweetlife Natural Food.  This year, the Lake Cumberland Corps of Engineers’ Park Ranger team contributed to the planning and organization of the event.

The top three finishers were from the same family, and they completed the course in less than 20 minutes. One person even competed barefooted.

Proceeds from this event go to the Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery’s School Field Trip Scholarship fund to help support groups that choose to visit Wolf Creek.
