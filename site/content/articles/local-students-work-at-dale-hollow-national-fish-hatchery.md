Clay County, Tennessee, residents Brandon Boles and Mila McCullough spent this summer working at the Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery as Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) enrollees.

The two helped the hatchery staff with feeding fish, collecting and counting dead fish, cleaning tanks and raceways, moving fish around the hatchery, distributing fish to local waters, performing janitorial work, maintaining the public fishing area, and doing general grounds maintenance. They also had the opportunity to help with the annual fish health inspection.  The extra help provided by the YCC enrollees was greatly appreciated by the hatchery staff members.

One of the highlights of this year’s program was that the enrollees got a chance to tour Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery in Jamestown, Kentucky, and they spent time in its visitor/environmental education center.  

The three objectives of the YCC program are to accomplish needed conservation work on public lands, provide gainful summer employment to youth for about eight weeks, and develop an understanding and appreciation in participating youth of the nation’s natural environment and heritage.
