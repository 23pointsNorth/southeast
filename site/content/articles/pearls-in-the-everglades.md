This summer, for the third consecutive year, the [Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/arm_loxahatchee/) welcomed the Zeta Phi Beta sorority in support of the Pearls in the Wild initiative &mdash; a way to introduce young black women to the bountiful recreation opportunities available at their local national wildlife refuges. This effort has also been successful in providing opportunities to interact and learn from refuge staff about the different career opportunities in natural resources.

The refuge partnered with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and Glademasters Fishing Club to make the day a success.

The Zeta Phi Beta sorority was founded in 1920 at Howard University and is recognized nationally and internationally for their excellence in civic duty, charitable work, and support of youth. With over 100,000 members and chapters across the globe, the sorority is a prominent and influential organization for the black community in affecting positive change.

More than 40 members of the Belle Glade, Palm Beach, and Delray Beach chapters of Zeta Phi Beta visited the refuge for activities including a scavenger hunt on refuge trails, fishing, and an archery competition. This nationally recognized partnership between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Zeta Phi Beta has proven to be successful in creating a lasting partnership that ensures continuing opportunities for all Americans to learn about and enjoy our treasured national wildlife refuges.

The refuge looks forward to continuing this partnership and hosting the Zetas again in 2020.
