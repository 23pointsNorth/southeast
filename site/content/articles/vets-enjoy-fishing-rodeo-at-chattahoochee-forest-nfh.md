On Friday, May 3rd, Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery near Suches, Georgia, held its seventh annual Veterans Appreciation Fishing Rodeo. More than 150 U.S. military veterans and family members attended the free event.  Approximately 3,200 trout were stocked into Rock Creek especially for the event including a number of fish weighing 3 pounds or more. Partners including Friends of the Hatchery, Project Healing Waters, Fannin County EMS, Appalachian Judicial Court System, and Trout Unlimited Chapters of Blairsville, Blue Ridge, Dahlonega, Clarkesville and others assisted with the event. Representatives from the Georgia Department of Veterans Services and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs were also available to provide information to veterans. Friends of the hatchery provided a free BBQ lunch and gave away fishing rods and reels to Veterans for future fishing adventures.
