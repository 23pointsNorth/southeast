An increased affection for fly fishing has grown with the popularity of the newly extended Hatchery Creek that flows from [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek).  Last year, Moria Painter partnered with fly fishing experts throughout Kentucky to offer monthly fly fishing workshops on topics ranging from basic rigging and knots to fly tying.  These workshops sparked an appetite for fly-fishing with newcomers to the sport from Kentucky and nearby states.

This year, Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery; with the help of Professional Volunteer Fly Fisherman Mark Lamberth, is offering a fly fishing day at Hatchery Creek on the second Saturday of each month.  Mark offers a morning and afternoon session for up to eight participants each session.  Each session offers basic fly fishing instruction, as well as tips on gear and rigging.  The free sessions are open to anyone who can hold and cast a fly rod.  Rain or shine, people have been lining up for Markâ€™s expert instruction.  Participants range in age from youth to mature adults.  According to Mark, the women usually outfish the men.
