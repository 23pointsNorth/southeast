On Saturday, June 3, Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and the Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery held the 31st annual Catch a Rainbow Kids’ Fishing Derby.  This event, which has grown since its beginning in 1986, coincides with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources’ Free Fishing Weekend.  The Free Fishing weekend offers residents and non-residents the opportunity to fish Kentucky waters without a license or permit.  This provides fun-filled fishing for the whole family, with little to no cost for participants. 

More than 1,250 children participated in the fishing derby this year.  Counting all participants, there were more than 3,000 attendees. All visitors were provided with unlimited complimentary hot dogs, chips, drinks, and snow cones. In addition to fishing at the creek, children could practice their archery skills with Ducks Unlimited, hone their casting skills with the Friends Group, meet up with Smokey Bear for a photo-op, and have their face painted. Each child took home a goodie bag of items, including a reusable Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery, Inc. water bottle, and many even won prizes such as fishing poles, sleeping bags, tackle boxes, and tents.  

Support and planning for this event came about through generous donations of more than 100 volunteers and over 100 sponsors. Thank you to everyone who assisted with making this event successful.
