On March 10, 2018, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s [Louisiana Ecological Services Field Office](/lafayette) and the Baton Rouge Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office participated in the Healing House’s Family Adventure Day fundraiser and community outreach event in Lafayette, Louisiana. The Healing House provides support for children grieving the loss of a loved one. 

The Service’s station was one of over 40 activity locations that families could visit throughout Lafayette. The success of our activity and being considered one of the family favorite stops could not have happened without the efforts of our partners including Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the City of Lafayette Acadiana Park Nature Station, the USGS Coastal Wetland Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act Outreach Program, and many volunteers.

At our activity the families transformed into citizen scientists and learned how to help scientist collect data and protect fish and wildlife resources.  They learned how to use binoculars and identify wildlife by sight and sound, how to enter observations into online databases that help scientist track fish and wildlife including listed and at-risk species, and how to protect and restore habitats.  Families also were able to get up close to live alligators and a Louisiana pinesnake.  More than 350 participants selected the Service’s activity as one of their adventures.
