Following the release of their spring seasonal beer, Little Hump Spring Ale, Highland Brewing Company is teaming with the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to offer an opportunity to learn about and visit the peak recognized by the seasonal beer, Little Hump Mountain, found in the Roan Mountain area of Mitchell County.

On April 6, the brewery will host Jay Leutze in their tasting room, from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m., sharing the story of the Roan Mountain area. Leutze, who sits on the board of trustees for the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy, lives in the shadow of Roan Mountain and has long been involved in conserving the area.

On May 21, the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy will host a guided hike to Little Hump Mountain.

“With good weather, a hike to Little Hump Mountain offers some of the best views in the Southern Appalachians, and gives people a chance to hike through some of the rarest habitats in North America,” said Carl Silverstein, executive director of the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy.

Little Hump Mountain, at 5460 ft., is one of many peaks  found in the area along the North Carolina-Tennessee border known as the Roan Massif, or Roan Mountain. The area, in Mitchell County, NC, and Carter County, TN is one of the most biodiverse areas of the southern Appalachians and was once considered for national park status. It’s home to rare habitats such as spruce-fir forests and grassy balds, and a number of rare plants and animals, including the spruce-fir moss spider, an endangered species that is the world’s smallest tarantula.

For more information on Leutze’s presentation, or to register for the hike, contact the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy at Claire@appalachian.org or (828) 253-0095, ext.205. Both events are free and open to the public.
