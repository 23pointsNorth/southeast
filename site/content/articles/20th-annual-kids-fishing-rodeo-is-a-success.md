On the morning of June 10, a total of 2,000 nine-inch rainbow and 10 large display rainbow trout and brook trout were released in the creek below the Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery in Tennessee for the 10th annual Kids’ Fishing Rodeo. 

Held in celebration of National Fishing and Boating Week, the rodeo is open to young people aged 15 and under.  The event is co-sponsored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Friends of Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery, Friends of Dale Hollow Lake, and the citizens of Clay County, Tennessee. It presents a great opportunity for families to spend quality time together and to connect children with nature.

The Friends of Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery distributed free hot dogs.  The role of master of ceremonies was shared by Corps Ranger Spencer Bilbrey and Friends Group President Paul Boyce.  The Clay County Emergency Medical Service also assisted with the event.

Participants registered for random prize drawings which took place throughout the morning.  This year’s highlights included use of a kiddie pool for younger anglers and face painting.  Ten staff members from participating agencies, four volunteers, and six Friends Group members worked together to make this event a huge success. Tl Attendance was 215 children and about 160 adults.  People from Florida, Wisconsin, and Ohio made the long trip to Celina to get the chance to catch a rainbow trout.
