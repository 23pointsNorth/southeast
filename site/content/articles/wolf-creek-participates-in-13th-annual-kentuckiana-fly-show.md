On Jan. 27, 2018, I represented [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek) at the 13th Annual Kentuckiana Fly Show in Shepherdsville, Kentucky. Derby City Fly Fishers, a non-profit organization based in Louisville, hosts the Kentuckiana Fly Show each year, drawing about 400 members of the public.

More than 40 exhibitors and vendors participated, including professional fly-fishing guides,  government agencies, and non-profit organizations.

Representatives from the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources were available to answer questions concerning regulations. Hatchery Creek and trout stockings were hot topics at the Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery booth.

The hatchery capitalized on the opportunity to network with representatives from a multitude of fly-fishing affiliated organizations, and welcomed them to participate in Wolf Creek’s upcoming event, Fly Fishing Conclave, on Aug. 10-11.  Last year, Wolf Creek offered a series of monthly fly-fishing workshops, each focusing on a different topic of fly-fishing. These workshops were highly successful, and introduced many to fly-fishing for the first time. Wolf Creek’s environmental education and outreach team has even bigger plans for the Fly Fishing Conclave.  They are planning to include a variety of sessions that will appeal to beginning and advanced anglers.
