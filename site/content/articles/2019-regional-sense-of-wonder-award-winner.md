It is with great pride we announce Patricia Midgett, visitor services manager at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, located in South Carolina, as our 2019 Regional "Sense Of Wonder" Award recipient.

The Sense of Wonder Recognition Program recognizes a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employee who has designed, implemented, or shown visionary leadership in an interpretive or environmental education program that fosters a sense of wonder and enhances public stewardship of our wildlife heritage.

The program recognizes individuals who:

1. performed outstanding work in the field of interpretation and environmental education during the last year or several years (project based), or
2. demonstrated sustained quality performance in the field of interpretation and environmental education over a longer period of time (career-based).

Congratulations, Tricia!
