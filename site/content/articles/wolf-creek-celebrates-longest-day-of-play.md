Kentucky’s [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](fws.gov/wolfcreek) is proud of its long-standing tradition of collaborating with the local Russell County Health Coalition to promote healthy lifestyles in the community.  Each June, we join our partners in celebrating the Longest Day of Play, a day set aside to celebrate the longest day of the year.  The goal is to encourage physical, outdoor activity among children and families in the community.  The event provides a great opportunity for community members to volunteer, play, and learn.

This year, more than 200 participants were treated to healthy snacks, games and activities, and a take-home goodie bag full of things to use all year long – water bottles, Frisbees, jump ropes, sports balls, and magnifying glasses.  Participants enjoyed a nature hike with a naturalist, animal olympics, recycle relay, and the popular slack line balance. 

The Longest Day of Play was made even better this year by coordinating with the local summer school program.
