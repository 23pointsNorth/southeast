On Tuesday, October 2, 2018, Trout in the Classroom representative Roger Johnson visited [Chattahoochee Forest National Fish Hatchery](/chattahoochee-forest) for help in setting up Fannin County High School’s Trout in the Classroom program. For a long time, the hatchery has partnered with Trout Unlimited by providing rainbow trout eggs to local schools participating in the program. Students begin with fertilized trout eggs and end with three-or-four-inch fingerling trout that are stocked by the students into local trout streams. Throughout the program, students learn about the trout’s life cycle while participating in trout rearing and water quality monitoring and management.
