This spring, Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery staff members transferred 74 adult Barrens topminnows to personnel from Conservation Fisheries, Inc. (CFI) out of Knoxville, Tennessee.  CFI staff then transported these fish to Coffee County in middle Tennessee to supplement one of the few remaining stable populations.  The Barrens topminnow is an imperiled fish endemic to the Barrens region of the state, and populations exist in only a few sites in the Elk River and Caney Fork systems. 
 
The usual suspects have contributed to the decline of this species, including habitat loss from agricultural practices and land development, and the introduction of the non-native Western mosquitofish. The mosquitofish, also a topminnow, out-reproduces and out-competes the native topminnow and preys on juvenile Barrens topminnows. Droughts also have affected some populations, especially the type locality population, which usually requires rescue in dry years when the type locality pool is reduced to nothing more than a puddle.

Not wanting to come back empty-handed, Wolf Creek staff members returned to the hatchery in Jamestown, Kentucky, with 138 juvenile Barrens topminnows spawned at CFI.  These fish, grown out at Wolf Creek, will be released into the type locality location next year.  Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and CFI are just two of several partners that are working together to save this fish.
