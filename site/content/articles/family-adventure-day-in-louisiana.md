On March 11, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Louisiana Ecological Services Office and the Baton Rouge Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office participated in the Healing House’s Family Adventure Day fundraiser and community outreach event in Lafayette, Louisiana. The Healing House provides support for children grieving the loss of a loved one.

The Service’s station was one of 43 activity locations that families could visit throughout Lafayette. More than 250 participants selected the Service’s activity as one of their adventures. Families learned about at-risk species and habitats through many hands-on activities, including a fish sampling activity, a coastal habitat identification activity, and a bat echolocation activity. Families learned about conservation efforts for the Louisiana black bear, red-cockaded woodpecker, and whooping crane. They met Luigi, a Louisiana pinesnake; and they were enthusiastic to learn about pollinators and to see an active beehive and bee-keeping equipment.

This event could not have happened without the efforts of our partners, including Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the City of Lafayette Acadiana Park Nature Station, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Coastal Wetland Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act Outreach Program, and many volunteers, including local bee-keepers.
