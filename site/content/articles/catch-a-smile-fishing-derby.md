On September 26, 2017, [Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery](https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek/) in Kentucky hosted its annual Catch a Smile Senior Fishing Derby, inviting anyone 62 years or older to participate. This year marked the 10th anniversary of the event, which was  established to promote outdoor activity and connect senior citizens with nature.

More than 130 seniors joined in on the fun -- fishing at Hatchery Creek, sharing  a complimentary lunch, and winning a prize. [The Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery, Inc.](https://www.friendsofwolfcreeknfh.com/), sought donations from community members in order to cover the costs of lunch as well as the prizes that were given away. Thank you to everyone who assisted with the planning, preparation, and execution of this event.
