Chattahoochee Forest project leader Kelly Taylor and program assistant Crystal Thomas met with community representatives and volunteers in October, including representatives from Trout Unlimited chapters, government agencies, local newspapers, chambers of commerce, and a local radio station. Project leader Kelly Taylor presented appreciation certificates for volunteer support provided throughout the hatcheryâ€™s 2017 fishing and outreach events, including the Veterans Appreciation Fishing Rodeo, Special Kids Fishing Rodeo, Seniors Fishing Rodeo and Family Fishing Festival.

These events are a huge success each year due to the outpouring of community and volunteer support. They help get the word out about the events, provide kids with one-on-one assistance with fishing, and clean up the hatchery grounds.

Some of the organizations providing help and support to the hatchery this year included the _Fannin Sentinel_, the Fannin Chamber of Commerce, Georgia Forestry Commission, WPPL Radio, Fannin County EMS Fire and Rescue, Blue Ridge Trout Unlimited, The News Observer, North Georgia News, House of Prayer and First Baptist Church in Blairsville, Blairsville Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Forest Service.
