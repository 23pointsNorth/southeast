The Friends of Wolf Creek NFH are ramping up to prepare for another successful year of fishing events. Each year, Wolf Creek NFH hosts five fishing events for various constituents including children, wounded veterans, senior citizens, and local children with physical and intellectual disabilities. Each event provides a day of fishing and outdoor fun, including complimentary lunch. Approximately 4,500 individuals enjoy these events.  With the total cost of combined fishing events topping $46,000 dollars each year, Friends of Wolf Creek NFH relies heavily on sponsors and donations to keep the events free. 

On March 27, 2017, members of the local Mark Twain Shrine Club, from Columbia, Kentucky, presented Friends of Wolf Creek NFH President Jeff Powers with a corporate sponsorship of $1500 from Kosair Charities, the charitable branch of Kosair Temple. This sponsorship will go towards the costs of the Reaching for Rainbows Special Needs Kids’ Fishing Derbies, which will be held during the last week in September this year. 

Kosair Charities, also known as “Shriners,” are dedicated to assisting children with medical requirements. This philanthropic group is responsible for the Shriners Hospital for Children, which assists children with a variety of complex medical issues including burns, spinal cord injuries, and orthopaedic conditions. 

In addition to the sponsorship from Kosair Charities, Friends of Wolf Creek NFH has received several other sponsorships.
