Participants enjoyed a lunch of grilled hamburgers, hotdogs, chips, drinks and desserts.  Each participant took home a door prize, provided by local sponsors, that included camp lights, camp chairs, camp coffee pots, flashlights, fishing gear, and many other items.  The highlight of the day was Hatchery Creek, which was stocked with 600 12‚Äù-plus rainbow trout, with most participants catching at least one, and many catching their limit.
