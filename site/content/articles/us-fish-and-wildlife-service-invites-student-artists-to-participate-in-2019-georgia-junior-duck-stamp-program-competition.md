The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently accepting student entries postmarked by midnight Friday, March 15, for the 2019 Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program competition.

The Georgia Junior Duck Stamp competition recognizes Georgia’s top student waterfowl artists.  Public, private, home-schooled, and art studio students from kindergarten through high school are invited to compete for recognition, prizes and scholarships in an activity that promotes the conservation of America’s wetlands and waterfowl habitat.

The winning artwork from the national art contest serves as the design for the Junior Duck Stamp, which the Service produces annually. This $5 stamp has become a collector’s item. All of the revenue from the sale of Junior Duck Stamps goes to support recognition and environmental education activities for students who participate in the program.

Last year, the Georgia-winning Best of Show by 18 year-old Rayen Kang of the First Fine Art & Design Studio in Johns Creek was selected as the national winner.  Her artwork, a rendition of an emperor goose, is currently featured on the 2018-2019 Junior Duck Stamp.
