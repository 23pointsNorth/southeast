The popular annual Kids Fish for Fun Day at the Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery in Georgia attracted more than 300 children aged three to 12 on June 10. The event was  held in conjunction with National Fishing Week activities.

Volunteers from the Friends Group, Benning Bass Club, parents, and staff members all worked together to ensure the kids had a good time.

Children had the opportunity to fish in one of two of our catfish ponds filled with thousands of fish.  They were allowed to take up to five fish home to eat. The event continues to increase in popularity, with 17 first time anglers this year.  People from surrounding cities and as far away as Auburn, Alabama, continue to attend.  Providing this opportunity for the kids to fish exposes them to the joys of fishing which may foster in them the love of protecting and enjoying the natural resources of the world. 

A total of 14 volunteers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees, and members of the Friends of Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery participated in the event.  Fort Benning Bass Club members taught children how to bait and cast.

This year, Kevin R. Wiley, Georgia Power Area Manager and a Meriwether County Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors member, generously donated more than 800 water bottles for the event. The Friends Group provided all of the snacks and goodie bags for the children.  Every child received a fishing pole and reel combo to take home so that they can continue to pursue the joys of fishing.

Providing this opportunity for young people exposes them to the joys of fishing, which may foster in them a love of protecting and enjoying the natural resources of the world.
