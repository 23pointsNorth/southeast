Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery in Kentucky celebrated Earth Day in a big way this year, with not one but two events.  This spring, Wolf Creek hosted an Earth Day event by partnering with many state and local agencies including The Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery, Lindsey Wilson College, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, Kentucky Division of Water, and the Russell County Library.  About 300 visitors participated in the event.

Participants were greeted by Smokey Bear and educated on fire safety. Representatives from the Russell County Library read “The Lorax” by Dr. Seuss and made crafts. Visitors also could make recycled crafts, learn about natural fibers, and tap into water quality, recycling, and sustainability projects. They also were invited to explore the onsite wetland to discover many cool critters.  The Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery distributed free trees.

The Earth Day celebration continued the next day when Moria Painter and Ashley Buffington participated in the annual Somerset Community College Earth Day event.  Over 1,300 people attended.  Patrons were treated to hands-on demonstrations of point and non-point water pollution.
