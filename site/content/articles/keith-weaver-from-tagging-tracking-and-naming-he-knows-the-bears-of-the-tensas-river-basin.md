“My life consists of being on the computer, being on the phone, being in a meeting, or driving to a meeting,” says Keith Weaver, the Project Leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s [Central Arkansas National Wildlife Refuge Complex](http://www.fws.gov/cacheriver/).

But this was certainly not the case in late 1987, when Weaver became involved with the Louisiana black bear as the wildlife biologist at [Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge](http://www.fws.gov/refuge/tensas_river/).

Back then Weaver collected data to help determine if the species qualified for listing as endangered or threatened. This involved everything from collecting blood and tissues samples from bears, to tracking them with collars, to tattooing numbers on their inner upper lips.

“They were a real mystery when we started,” he says. “We knew bears existed on the national wildlife refuge and in the Tensas River basin. But that’s all we knew … this was really ground-breaking work to just understand the life history and ecology of the bear.”

It was very unusual to ever see one back then, he recalls.

“I can remember we bought 10 radio collars when we started out, and being worried we wouldn’t be able to catch 10 bears.”

In fact, between 1988 and 1991, Weaver and his colleagues trapped, released, and studied a total of 24 bears.

“It was pretty amazing,” Weaver says. “You had this bear in hand, and after you released it, you still had a relationship with the bear -- so to speak -- because you were following its activities.”

Weaver confesses that, although it’s frowned upon in some scientific circles, he and his co-workers gave the bears names in alphabetic order, by when they were trapped. His favorites were “Betty Bear,” and “Xeres” -- the last one caught. They never made it to Z.

Even though almost 30 years have passed, Weaver remembers how he felt catching  the first bear for the endangered status assessment.

“We’d been trying to trap a bear for about a week, without any luck,” he says. “We had had a couple of snares that had been sprung, so we were a bit discouraged. And, of course, expectations were high. People were waiting. The pressure was on.”

He says he came around a corner on the trail riding an ATV – and there was “Alpha.”

“I felt a mixture of relief, of elation, of success,” he recalls. “We were off to the races!”

“Bears are very charismatic creatures,” Weaver says. “ They have characteristics that people can relate to. They seem to be very gentle with their clubs, but they can at times be strict disciplinarians. Plus they can stand up on two legs, which reminds us of us.”

A major difference is that, luckily for them, their lives don’t revolve around computers, phones and meetings.
