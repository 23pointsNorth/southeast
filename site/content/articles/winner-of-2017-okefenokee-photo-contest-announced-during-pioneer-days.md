As 2017 draws to a close, so does one of our wonderful yearly events at [Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee/) in Georgia. Our third annual photography contest was our biggest yet with more than 90 submissions. 

Everyone who participated helped to capture the essence of the refuge; the beautiful photos ranged from birds and alligators to families and sunrises. 

This year’s winner, Stefan Mazzola, was announced at the Pioneer Day Festival on Nov. 18, 2017.  Mazzola’s photo was taken on a three-day overnight trip to Monkey Lake and features the beauty of the night sky in the Okefenokee.  He started with photography about 15 years ago using a film camera and slide film. Mazzola enjoys exploring and photographing the lakes, rivers, and wetlands in the southeastern United States.

Mazzola will have his photo printed on our annual passes for the following year. All of the submissions will be displayed in the Richard S. Bolt Visitor Center at the refuge’s main entrance. The contest occurs each year in late summer with submissions being accepted until September 30. Voting is by refuge staff members and volunteers.
