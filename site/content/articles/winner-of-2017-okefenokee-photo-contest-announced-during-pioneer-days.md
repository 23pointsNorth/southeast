The winner of Okefenokee’s third annual photography contest is Stefan Mazzola. He took a beautiful photo of the night sky over [Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee/) during a three-day overnight trip to Monkey Lake. His photo was one of more than 90 submissions. Everyone who participated in this event helped to capture the essence of the refuge. The photos range from subjects of birds and alligators, to families and sunrises. The contest occurs each year in late summer with submissions being accepted until September 30. Each year, refuge staff members and volunteers vote for their favorite photo.

The selection of Mazzola’s photo was announced at the Pioneer Day Festival on November 18, 2017. He started with photography about 15 years ago using a film camera and slide film. Mazzola enjoys exploring and photographing the lakes, rivers, and wetlands in the southeastern United States.

Mazzola’s photo appears on Okefenokee’s 2018 annual pass. To honor all of our submissions and submitters, all of the submissions have been printed and are displayed in the Richard S. Bolt Visitor Center at the refuge’s main entrance. The refuge is thankful for such great participation in the 2017 refuge photo contest and another great year of photos. Practice and sit tight – fall will be here before you know it!
