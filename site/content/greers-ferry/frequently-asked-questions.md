## Where can I purchase a fishing license?

The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service does not issue fishing licenses.

## Why do we need federal hatcheries and who pays for them?

Fish raised on federal hatcheries are stocked in public waters to support federal fishery responsibilities. These include fish for restoration where, for example, man-made dams have altered a stream’s natural reproductive capability; or to restore threatened or endangered populations. Fish are also used to support recreational fishing programs in federal and state waters. Federal fish hatcheries are supported by tax dollars.

## Do you have any fish for breeding? Where do you get the fish?

Greers Ferry does not have any adult trout for breeding purposes. The hatchery receives fertilized eggs from other federal broodstock hatcheries, such as [Erwin National Fish Hatchery](http://www.fws.gov/erwin) in Erwin, TN.

## Where are the fish stocked? How often?

The trout are stocked in public fishing waters in Arkansas and Oklahoma which are suitable for trout. Trout are stocked year-round. Annually, hatchery personnel stock the Little Red River adjacent to the hatchery with approximately 180,000 eleven inch rainbow trout.

## Will trout live in a small pond?

Trout require cold water, usually less than 65°F, with lots of dissolved oxygen. In the Southeast, farm ponds get too warm for trout in the summer months. Rivers and tailwaters below large dams are more suitable habitat for rainbow and brook trout.

## Is the hatchery open every day? What hours? It there a charge?

The hatchery is open every day except Thanksgiving and Christmas. Visiting hours are 7:00am - 3:00pm. Entry to the hatchery is free.

## Do you provide fish to private individuals?

The hatchery does not provide fish to individuals. All fish raised at this facility are stocked into public waters.

## Do you give tours of the hatchery?

Tours are self-guided. The public viewing areas include a small visitor center and the outdoor fish rearing area called raceways.

## Economic impact

For every $1 of hatchery operational budget spent, $44 was put back into the economy (2017 economic data). [Download the 2017 economic impact fact sheet](/pdf/fact-sheet/economic-impacts-of-trout-production-greers-ferry-nfh.pdf).
