## Location

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, South Atlantic-Gulf and Mississippi Basin Region Office  
1875 Century Blvd NE, Atlanta, GA 30345  
Sam Hamilton B Conference Room  

## Description

This 3-day training workshop will provide a comprehensive overview of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hydropower licensing process for USFWS and other agency staff. The primary target audience is USFWS field staff tasked with representing USFWS interests and providing consultation and stakeholder engagement in the FERC hydropower licensing process. Other federal and state agency personnel with job responsibilities related to the FERC hydropower licensing process are also invited to participate. Further details, logistics, and a workshop agenda will be posted here as planning proceeds, so be sure to check back in the future.

## Registration

[Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxRV-6RYF0J1ic6NWJQ11dwv1S0DmUkMNgaGk4REtpr1L3aQ/viewform) will be limited to 32 participants. There is no registration fee, but attendees will be responsible for their own travel costs. Priority will be given to USFWS staff from the states in the legacy Southeast Region or the new Department of the Interior unified South Atlantic-Gulf and Mississippi Basin regions (AL, AR, FL, GA, IA, KY, LA, MO, MS, NC, PR/VI, SC, TN). However, we anticipate that a number of seats will be available for participants from other agencies/partners or those from outside the region.

If you are interested in participating, please [submit your registration request by December 13, 2019](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxRV-6RYF0J1ic6NWJQ11dwv1S0DmUkMNgaGk4REtpr1L3aQ/viewform). We  will let respondents know whether their registration request has been accepted no later than December 18, 2019. A draft workshop agenda and logistics information (e.g., transportation and lodging options) will be provided at that time.
