{{< content-scroller tag="Monito Gecko" heading="Related content" >}}

The Monito gecko, a tiny lizard that lives only on Monito Island off the west coast of Puerto Rico, was listed as endangered in 1982 due to an influx of black rats, a non-native omnivore that preyed upon the species throughout its range. In 1992,  Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER) began a black rat eradication project on Monito Island  and the agency mounted a second eradication initiative in 1999. Thanks to these efforts, and assistance from a variety of other conservation partners, black rats have been officially eradicated from the island.  There are now an estimated 5,000 -11,000 geckos on Monito Island.

On October 3, 2019,  the Service removed the Monito gecko from the List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife under the Endangered Species Act due to recovery. The gecko is now so abundant that it no longer warrants protection under the Endangered Species Act thanks to the effective conservation partnership between the Service and the PRDNER that successfully removed the gecko’s main threat and continues to protect the resilient lizard and its habitat.

## Appearance

The Monito gecko is the only species of the Sphaerodactylus genus found on Monito Island. It is a tiny reptile, usually measuring an inch and a half (3.5 centimeters) long. It has a pale-tan body and dark-brown mottling on it's back, a dark brown tail, and can have two dark patches with a white dot on its neck.

## Habitat

The gecko can be found on the ground, mostly hiding during the day within leaf litter and debris, and small crevasses and holes in the karst rock of Monito Island.

## Diet

It is assumed the geckos feed on small invertebrates such as insects and spiders. However, there is no specific information regarding their feeding habits.

## Current range

This gecko is only found in Monito Island. This island is part of the Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserve of Puerto Rico managed by the PRDNER.  Monito Island is located about 50 miles (80 km) west of Puerto Rico’s mainland and 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Mona Island. Both islands are located between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

## Conservation challenges

The destruction and modification of habitat by humans and the previous occurrence of introduced rats to Monito Island represent the biggest threats to the Monito gecko. Due to controlled access to Monito Island and other protective measures set in place by the PRDNER, threats have been reduced. The PRDNER implemented a rat eradication program, and the island has been rat free since late 1999.  Visitors are forbidden from visiting Monito Island without authorization, and it is given only to scientific research-related projects.

## Recovery from endangered status

The Monito gecko has improved in status due to the active partnerships of many private landowners, state and Federal agencies, universities, and non-governmental organizations Thanks to an effective conservation partnership between the Service and the PRDNER, the Monito gecko is now so abundant that it no longer warrants protection under the Endangered Species Act.  On October 3, 2019,  the Service removed the Monito gecko from the List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife  due to successful recovery.

A post-delisting monitoring plan is in place to ensure the population’s long-term viability. The plan summarizes the species’ current status, defines thresholds for potential monitoring outcomes and conclusions, outlines reporting procedures and responsibilities, and other conservation actions. Post-delisting monitoring will be completed through the cooperative efforts of the Service, PRDNER, and other partners.
