The red wolf is one of the world’s most endangered wolves. Once common throughout the Eastern and South Central United States, red wolf populations were decimated by the early 20th century as a result of intensive predator control programs and the degradation and alteration of the species' habitat. When the red wolf was designated endangered in 1967, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated efforts to conserve and recover the species. Today, about 40 red wolves roam their native habitats in eastern North Carolina as a non-essential, experimental population (NEP), and more than 200 red wolves are maintained in captive breeding facilities throughout the United States.

## Appearance

The red wolf (_Canis rufus_) is a native North American canid intermediate in size between the coyote (_Canis latrans_) and gray wolf (_Canis lupus_). Red wolves are mostly brown and buff colored with some black along their backs, often with a reddish color on their ears, head and legs. Adult red wolves range in weight from about 45 to 80 pounds. Red wolves have wide heads with broad muzzles, tall pointed ears and long, slender legs with large feet. Red wolves stand about 26 inches at their shoulder and are about 4 feet long from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail.

## Habitat

The last red wolves were found in coastal prairie and marsh habitat because this was the last area in which the animals were allowed to remain. Any habitat area in the Southeastern United States of sufficient size, which provides adequate food, water, and cover, should be suitable habitat for the red wolf. Telemetry studies indicate that red wolf home range requirements vary from about 25 to 50 square miles.

## Range

## Diet

Although the exact diet of red wolves varies depending on available prey, it usually consists of a combination of white-tailed deer, raccoons and smaller mammals such as rabbits, rodents and nutria. The red wolf is an opportunistic feeder and can travel up to 20 miles a day or more to find food, which can be consumed at a rate of two to five pounds daily.

## Behavior

Red wolves are social animals that live in close-knit packs. Typical packs consist of five to eight animals, including a breeding adult pair and their offspring of different years. Older offspring will often assist the breeding pair in pup rearing. Almost all offspring between one and two years of age will leave the pack or “disperse” to form their own pack.

Red wolves tend to form pair-bonds for life and mate once a year in February. Pups are typically born in April or May in well-hidden dens that may be located in hollow trees, stream banks and sand knolls. Dens have also been found in holes dug in the ground near downed logs or forest debris piles. Fewer than half of wolf pups born in the wild survive to adulthood. Survival rates are affected by disease, malnutrition and predation.

Wolf packs have specific territories that they actively defend against other canids, including other wolves. Most active at dusk and dawn, red wolves are elusive and generally avoid humans and human activity.

## Threats

Human-caused mortality (e.g., vehicle strikes, gunshots) can remove breeders from the wild wolf population. These threats, combined with habitat fragmentation from increasing development, allow coyotes to expand into the NEP area. Coyotes may directly compete with wolves for resources, as well as introduce diseases, and dilute wolf genetic lines through hybridization. This is particularly true when a pack has lost one of the adults from the breeding pair close to mating season.

## Red wolf recovery program review

In 2013, the Service and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) entered into broad agreement acknowledging growing concerns from private landowners regarding management of the NEP population in the North Carolina Albemarle Peninsula. Both agencies recognized steps were needed to improve management of the NEP, which included the need to conduct an evaluation of the Red Wolf Recovery Program and the implementation of recovery actions in the NEP’s five counties in northeastern North Carolina.

To that end, [in 2014 the Service contracted with the Wildlife Management Institute (WMI) to conduct an independent evaluation](/news/2014/08/eastern-north-carolina-red-wolf-population-under-review/) focused on three primary elements: supporting science, program management, and human dimensions. WMI reviewed [more than 200 documents](/reading-room?q=Red+wolf+evaluation), interviewed Service and NCWRC staff at various management levels, commissioned literature reviews of red wolf genetics and ecology, held two public meetings in the red wolf restoration area, and conducted public opinion surveys.

In light of [the findings from the WMI evaluation](/pdf/report/wmi-red-wolf-review.pdf), the Service [expanded the review in June 2015](/news/2015/06/service-halts-red-wolf-reintroductions-pending-examination-of-recovery-program/) to include the recovery efforts beyond the program’s non-essential, experimental population in North Carolina. The objective of expanding the scope was to identify actions necessary to guide red wolf recovery on the landscape. The review was part of the Service’s continuing commitment to ensure the science is right and foster trust with stakeholders as issues regarding the recovery of the red wolf were addressed and implemented.

The Service took steps to involve state partners and key stakeholders in the ongoing review. [A multi-faceted recovery team was reconvened in October 2015](/news/2015/10/update-red-wolf-recovery-review-progressing-towards-recommendations/) to address current and future needs to restore red wolves in the wild. The team — comprised of representatives from federal and state agencies, university scientists, species experts, representatives from non-governmental organizations, county officials, and private landowners — reviewed the implementation of recovery actions and the science of red wolf conservation related to species taxonomy and historical range, population viability, and human dimensions.

On Sept. 12, 2016, [the Service announced significant changes for red wolf recovery](/news/2016/09/science-leads-fish-and-wildlife-service-to-significant-changes-for-red-wolf-recovery/) after completing the two year, two-step review. The Service is committed to recovering the species.

One of the most surprising findings of the Service’s review was that genetic diversity of the captive population will decline. Higher success in maintaining genetic diversity is needed to ensure a secure captive population and persistence of the red wolf species. Additionally, more animals are needed in captivity to secure the species’ survival and to support any wild population, including the current NEPin North Carolina.

[Visit the reading room for a list of publications and other supporting documentation used in the evaluation of the program](/reading-room?q=Red+wolf+evaluation).

In April 2018, the Service published a new [Species Status Assessment](http://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/147196) of the most current scientific information, and a [five-year review](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc5714.pdf) for the red wolf.

In the five-year review, the Service recommended no change in the endangered status of the red wolf under the Endangered Species Act, a status that has been in place since 1967.

Also in April, the Service said it is moving to begin work with an independent organization as directed by Congress to determine within one year whether the red wolf represents a taxonomically valid species designation.
