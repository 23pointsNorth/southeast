## Appearance

The Black Warrior waterdog is a large, aquatic, nocturnal salamander that permanently retains a larval form and external gills throughout its life (Conant and Collins 1998, pp. 419-420). Its head and body are depressed, its tail is compressed laterally, and it has four toes on each of its four feet. Larval Black Warrior waterdogs (28 to 48 millimeters (mm) 1 to 2 inches total length) are dark brown or black on their dorsum (upper surfaces) and have two light stripes running along their sides.

Adults may reach a maximum of 240 mm or 9 ½ inches total length, with sub-adults (40 to 100 mm 1 ½ to 4 inches total length) do not have the stripes that are present on larvae and are not conspicuously marked although they do have a dark stripe extending from the nostril through the eye to the gills. Adults are usually brown, may be spotted or unspotted, and retain the dark eye stripe. The ventral surface of all age classes is plain white.

## Habitat

The Black Warrior waterdog is only found in streams within the Black Warrior River Basin in Alabama.

Black Warrior waterdogs depend on specific stream substrates for normal and robust life processes such as breeding, rearing, protection of young, protection of adults when threatened, foraging, and feeding. Preferred substrates are dominated by clay or bedrock with little sand, also containing abundant rock crevices and rock slabs for retreats (shelter) and areas for egg laying.

Based on Neuse River waterdog research breeding sites are large bedrock outcrops or large boulders with sand and gravel beneath them. Retreat areas for Neuse River waterdog were on the downstream side of the shelter (usually rock slab) and were actively developed and maintained free of algae and debris. Excessive siltation of the crevices and leaf packs removes foraging, feeding, breeding and retreat areas for the Black Warrior waterdog. Therefore, based on the above information, we identify essential physical and biological feature for the Black Warrior waterdog to be hard bottom substrate with a combination of boulders, rock slabs, and rock outcrops; riparian buffer width of 100ft with deciduous trees along banks to create leaf packs and reduce sedimentation; and seasonal flow to provide connectivity and to remove excessive sediment covering the stream bottom and leaf packs.

## Diet

Larval and adult Black Warrior waterdogs are assumed to be opportunistic carnivores but prey taken in the wild has not been described. Adults are attracted to traps baited with fish-flavored cat food. Captive Black Warrior waterdogs have eaten small fish and earthworms . Crayfish, isopods, amphipods, freshwater clams, and insects, including mayflies, caddisflies, dragonfly naiads, dytiscid beetles, and midges, have been reported as prey items in Gulf Coast waterdogs.

## Historic Range

There are a total of 11 historical records from sites in Blount, Tuscaloosa, Walker, and Winston Counties, Alabama. Black Warrior waterdog habitat is similar to that of the threatened flattened musk turtle (Sternotherus depressus) a species restricted to permanent streams above the Fall Line in the Black Warrior Basin.

## Current Range

The species is currently known from medium to large streams found in the Black Warrior River Basin (Sipsey Fork, Brushy Creek, Rush Creek, Locust Fork, Gurley Creek, Yellow Creek, and Brown Creek). Most of these streams contain sites with intact physical characteristics such as clay or bedrock substrate with little sand, also containing abundant rock crevices and rock slabs and other factors considered to as key PBFs. Heavy siltation could reduce cover, food, and smother nests and eggs.

## Conservation Challenges

Sedimentation can seriously affect Black Warrior waterdog by: reduction of food sources such as invertebrates;  physical alteration to the rocky habitats where they forage, take cover, and breed; and developing a substrate in which chemicals toxic to the species and their food sources may accumulate and persist. Black Warrior waterdogs are virtually in constant contact with the substrate and therefore also with any toxic chemicals present (Bailey 2000, pp 20).   Similarly, excessive nutrients promote dense filamentous growth on the substrate and within the water column, which may restrict retreat areas and breeding sites.

## Designated Critical Habitat

The ESA requires the Service to identify the location of habitat essential for the conservation of the Black Warrior waterdog, which it terms “critical habitat.”  Currently, there are 26 federally protected species found in the Basin, 15 of which are found in rivers and streams. There are currently 165 miles of critical habitat in the Basin.  The proposed designation will overlap with much of this and will only add 600 additional river miles. Existing critical habitat for these species will overlap 165 river miles of the recommended critical habitat.

The Service recommends designating critical habitat in eight units within the historic range of the Black Warrior waterdog.  The recommended critical habitat is comprised of 11 tributaries within the Black Warrior River Basin; three of the tributaries are on Bankhead National Forest (Lawrence and Winston Counties) and include Sipsey Fork, Brushy Creek, and Rush Creek; Locust Fork and Gurley Creek (Blount, Etowah, Marshall, and Jefferson Counties); Blackwater Creek and Browns Creek (Walker and Winston counties); North River, (Fayette and Tuscaloosa counties); Yellow Creek and Lye Branch (Tuscaloosa County); and Mulberry Fork (Cullman, Walker, and Winston counties).

Unit 8 falls completely within the boundaries of Bankhead National Forest, and approximately 10% of the land within the Unit is in private ownership.  The Bureau of Land Management has split estate Federal mineral ownership (all minerals to include coal) in various areas in the Basin.

Critical habitat is a tool within the ESA which identifies areas essential for the conservation of endangered or threatened species.  It does not set up a preserve or refuge, but may require special management considerations in the identified areas.  Therefore, designating critical habitat under the ESA does not affect private landowners unless the action involves federal funds, permits, or other federally activities.  The final decision to designate critical habitat essential to the Black Warrior Waterdog will be based on the best scientific information available.
