## Appearance

The red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) is a small bird measuring about 7 inches in length. Identifiable by its white cheek patch and black and white barred back. The males have a few red feathers, called a cockade. These red feathers usually remain hidden underneath black feathers between the black crown and white cheek patch unless the male is disturbed or excited. Female RCWs lack the red cockade. Juvenile males have a red 'patch' in the center of their black crown. This patch disappears during the fall of their first year at which time their cockades appear.

## Diet

The diet of red-cockaded woodpeckers consists mostly of insects in the egg, larvae and adult stages. These include beetles, ants, roaches, spiders and other insects found in or on pine trees. Fruits and seeds make up a small portion of the overall diet. Methods of foraging include flaking away bark and probing under the bark using their specialized forked tongue to extract insects. Large, older trees are preferred for foraging. In general, males forage on the limbs and upper trunk while females forage on the trunk below the crown. This division of foraging area is most noticeable in winter when insect numbers are at their lowest and their activity slows due to cold weather, making it harder for RCWs to detect prey. Differences in the foraging behavior of males and females may help to reduce competition between them when food is scarce.

Female red-cockaded woodpeckers have been documented searching for bone bits on the forest floor and stuffing them in tree crevices. Zoologists say that is the first known instance of a bird’s hoarding something for its mineral, rather than caloric content. Calcium rich bone is not rare, but the birds probably seek it to ensure stronger eggshells. They stash it in a tree so they won’t have to eat on the ground where they are vulnerable to predators.

## Habitat

The red-cockaded woodpecker is non-migratory, territorial, and lives in cooperative breeding social units called groups. These groups chatter and call throughout the day, using a great variety of vocalizations. It uses mature pine trees to develop nest cavities and is the only North American woodpecker that excavates its roost and nest cavities in living trees, usually in those which are infected with a fungus known as red-heart disease. Cavities can take three  years or more to excavate, and are occasionally abandoned and reoccupied.

Cavity trees tend to be in areas known as “clusters,” and may include one to 20 or more cavity trees on three to 60 acres. Clusters are made up of active (in use) and inactive (previously used) cavity trees within an area defended by a single group. Completed cavities that are being actively used have numerous, small resin wells which exude sap. The birds keep the sap flowing as a cavity defense mechanism against tree climbing predators.

Suitable nesting habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker include pine stands, or pine-dominated pine/hardwood stands, with a low or sparse understory and ample old-growth pines. Trees must be more than 60 years old to be suitable for cavity construction.  Longleaf pine is preferred where available, but they frequently use other species such as loblolly, shortleaf, slash and pond pine.

The red-cockaded woodpecker plays a vital role in the intricate web of life of pine forests. Red-cockaded woodpeckers are primary cavity nesters, meaning they are responsible for the construction of cavities. In the Southern pine ecosystem there are many secondary cavity users that benefit from the RCW’s work. RCWs are considered a keystone species because their cavities contribute to the diversity of species in the forest.

At least 27 species of vertebrates have been documented using RCW cavities, either for roosting or nesting. Species include insects, birds, snakes, lizards, squirrels and frogs. Many of these species only use the cavities that have been abandoned by RCWs; abandonment usually occurs because the entrance tunnel was enlarged by pileated woodpeckers. Southern flying squirrels, red-bellied woodpeckers, red-headed woodpeckers, Eastern bluebirds, brown-headed nuthatches, tufted titmice and great crested flycatchers are the species most commonly seen in RCW cavities, and can use normal, unenlarged cavities that RCWs could also use.

## Historic range

The birds inhabited the open pine forests of the southeast from New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia to Florida, west to Texas and north to portions of Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. The longleaf pine ecosystem initially disappeared from much of its original range because of early European settlement, widespread commercial timber harvesting and the turpentine industry. Commercial tree farming, urbanization and agriculture contributed to further declines. Much of the current habitat is also different from historical pine forests in which RCWs evolved. Today, many southern pine forests are young and an absence of fire has created a dense pine/hardwood forest.

## Current range

Today, the red-cockaded woodpecker is found in 11 states (AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, NC, MS, OK, SC, VA, and TX), and occurs on federal, state and private lands.

## Conservation challenges

- The loss of suitable habitat has caused the number of RCWs to decline by almost 99% since the time of European settlement. The primary habitat of the RCW, the longleaf pine ecosystem, has been reduced to 3% of its original expanse.
- Habitat fragmentation caused by development.
- Removing pine trees within the cluster contributes to habitat fragmentation, making the woodpeckers more vulnerable to predation (hawks) and more susceptible to having other bird species take over their nest cavities (known as kleptoparasitism). This happens much less frequently in uninterrupted pine stands but is more of a problem in the vicinity of human development.
- Lack of natural or prescribed fire, which is important in maintaining this type of ecosystem.
- Rat snakes and other tree climbing predators.
- Hardwood midstory encroachment results in cluster abandonment.

## Recovery program

The goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (Service) red-cockaded woodpecker recovery program is to conserve the species and the ecosystem upon which it depends. RCWs have increased in number range-wide in response to recovery and management programs, from an estimated 4,694 active clusters in 1993 to 7,794 today. On private lands, more than 40 percent of the known red-cockaded woodpeckers are benefiting from management approved by the Service through Memorandum of Agreements, Safe Harbor Agreements, and Habitat Conservation Plans.

The Service administers recovery and consultation programs for the red-cockaded woodpecker in accordance with the Endangered Species Act through 16 Ecological Services field offices in 11 states. In addition, the Service works to ensure consistent application of recovery and conservation programs on federal, state, and private lands. The Service promotes conservation, restoration, and ecologically sound management of the longleaf pine and related ecosystems.

## Partnerships, research and projects

U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Defense have developed special management guidelines for the woodpeckers on national forests and military installations. From 1994 to 2002, red-cockaded woodpecker populations increased as much as 50 percent at six military installations that include primary core populations required for delisting. These are Eglin Air Force Base (Florida), Fort Benning (Georgia), Fort Bragg (North Carolina), Fort Polk (Louisiana), Fort Stewart (Georgia), and Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (North Carolina). Recovery initiatives by private landowners are also conserving this species.
