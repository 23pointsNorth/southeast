- **Taxon:** *Anseriformes, Anatidae*
- **Range:** Northern pintail typically breed in the Prairie Pothole Region of the north-central United States, central Canada, and Alaska. They spend their winters in the southern United States and Mexico, especially along the Texas and Louisiana coasts of the Gulf of Mexico.
- **Status:** Not listed, low concern – More than 2.3 million northern pintail were estimated in the breeding population in 2018. However, substantial declines since the 1950s has resulted in restricted harvest regulations for this species.

## Habitat

During the breeding season, northern pintail nest primarily on the ground in grasslands, but they also nest in fallow croplands and winter wheat fields. Northern pintail migrate earlier than many other species of dabbling ducks, and they use primarily open wetlands including flooded portions of agricultural fields and coastal marshes.

## Diet

Northern pintail primarily feed in shallow water and consume seeds, invertebrates, and agricultural grains. Northern pintail are especially common during winter in harvested rice fields where waste grain is abundant. During the breeding season, they feed on animals  such as crustaceans, aquatic insects, and tadpoles.
