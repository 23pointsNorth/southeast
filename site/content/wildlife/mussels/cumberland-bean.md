- Status: Endangered

## Appearance

The Cumberland bean is a small mussel 2 to 2.5 inches in length with an elongated, elliptical shell. The surface of the shell is covered with irregular growth lines. The shell color is dark green, but it may appear black with numerous dark green rays on the posterior end. The color inside the shell varies from pearly white to bluish-white.

## Habitat

This mussel inhabits small to medium streams with sand and gravel bottoms. Sinking Creek, a tributary stream of the Ohio River located in Breckinridge County, Kentucky, is one place providing habitat.

## Diet

Mussels are filter feeders; they mainly eat phytoplankton, zooplankton, and bacteria suspended in the water. By drawing water inside their shells through a siphon, their gills filter out food and take in oxygen.

## Historic Range

The Cumberland bean was known only from the lower and upper tributary streams of the Tennessee River and the upper tributary streams of the Cumberland system. This species was known to be more abundant in the Cumberland system.

## Conservation Challenges
Impoundments, siltation, and pollution are major threats to the Cumberland bean. Acidic mine waste in the Little South Fork, Big South Fork, and Rockcastle River Drainages are known to affect the species.

## How You Can Help
Individuals can do a number of things to help protect mussels, such as:
- Conserving water to allow more water to remain in streams.
- Using pesticides responsibly, especially around streams and lakes, to prevent runoff into mussel habitats.
- Controlling soil erosion by planting trees and plants to avoid runoff of sediments into freshwater areas.
- Supporting practices for construction and maintenance of unpaved, rural dirt and gravel roads that minimize erosion and connectivity to our rivers and lakes.
- Supporting and follow zebra mussel quarantine, inspection, and decontamination programs to prevent the spread of zebra mussels, an invasive species that competes with native mussels.
