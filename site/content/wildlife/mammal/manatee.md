## News and Events

The Service will publish a 12-month finding before December 31, 2015 in response to a [petition to reclassify the species](http://www.fws.gov/northflorida/Releases-14/20140702_nr_Service_announces_90-day_Petition_finding_for_west_indian_manatee.html).

## Appearance

Manatees are large, elongated marine mammals with paired flippers and a large round or spoon-shaped tail. They can reach lengths of over 14 feet and weights of over 3,000 pounds. Manatees are typically greyish brown in color. They have sparse hairs spread across their bodies, with bristles about the muzzle.

## Habitat

Manatees are aquatic animals that live in marine, brackish, and freshwater found in coastal andriverine areas throughout their range. Preferred habitats include nearshore areas typified by submerged aquatic vegetation, such as sea grass and eel grass. Manatees feed along grass bed margins with access to deep water channels, where they flee when threatened.

Manatees may travel hundreds of miles during a year’s time, preferring to travel along channels and shorelines. In the southeastern U.S., manatees winter at warm water springs and in power plant outfalls to shelter against the cold. As the weather warms, manatees travel to feeding areas and other use areas, (quiet resting places, locations with available freshwater for drinking, etc.).

## Diet

Manatees feed on plants. They prefer submergent vegetation, such as turtle and manatee grass, and will feed on floating and emergent plants, as well. Manatees also require freshwater for drinking.

## Historic Range

Historically, West Indian manatees were found along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, throughout the Caribbean and as far south as Brazil's Atlantic coastline. However, due to hunting, habitat fragmentation and loss, and other factors, manatees have disappeared from various parts of their range. For example, manatees are no longer found in Guadeloupe and other islands in the Lesser Antilles due to hunting pressure.

## Current Range

Today, manatees are found in the southeastern U.S., eastern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, Guiana, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and in the Bahamas.

## Where can I see manatees?

In the U.S, good places to see manatees include [Blue Spring State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Blue-Spring) (Florida), the [Haulover Canal Manatee Viewing Area](http://spacecoasthiddengems.com/adventure-point/manatee-observation-deck-2) (Florida), and [Three Sisters Springs](http://www.fws.gov/refuge/crystal_river/) (Florida). For other places to view manatees visit [myfwc.com/education/wildlife/manatee/where-to-see](http://myfwc.com/education/wildlife/manatee/where-to-see/). Before you encounter a manatee be sure to brush up on the [FWC's viewing guidlines](http://myfwc.com/education/wildlife/manatee/viewing-guidelines/) to ensure the safety of both yourself and the manatees.

## Challenges

Primary threats to the West Indian manatee include habitat loss and fragmentation, watercraft collisions, entanglements in fishing gear, and others. Natural threats include harmful algal blooms, cold weather, tropical storms and hurricanes, and others.

## Significant Conservation Measures

Within the U.S., Federal and State rules protect habitat from development and efforts are being made to protect important wintering areas. Similarly, there are ongoing Federal and State efforts to reduce the number of watercraft collisions through the use of manatee protection areas that are posted and enforced. Fishing gear cleanup programs are helping to reduce the amount of gear in the water and rescue programs help those animals entangled in gear. Efforts are ongoing to protect manatees in other countries.

## What You can do to Help

If you boat or know a boater, please obey posted manatee protection area restrictions. When you travel slowly through these areas, you give manatees a chance to safely get out of your way. And when you travel slowly, they’re easier to see. Watching manatees has become a national pastime – enjoy! (You will improve your ability to see manatees if you wear sunglasses with brown, polarized lenses.)

## Where is it's Critical Habitat?

Critical habitat for the West Indian manatee only identifies areas in Florida. (Critical habitat was described in 1976. The Service was petitioned to revise critical habitat for this species in 2008. In 2010, we found that a revision was warranted but precluded.)

Critical Habitat for the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus) as described in 50 CFR 17.95:

Crystal River and its headwaters known as King's Bay, Citrus County; the Little Manatee River downstream from the U.S. Highway 301 bridge, Hillsborough County; the Manatee River downstream from the Lake Manatee Dam, Manatee County; the Myakka River downstream from Myakka River State Park, Sarasota and Charlotte Counties; the Peace River downstream from the Florida State Highway 760 bridge, De Soto and Charlotte Counties; Charlotte Harbor north of the Charlotte-Lee County line, Charlotte County; Caloosahatchee River downstream from the Florida State Highway 31 bridge, Lee County; all U.S. territorial waters adjoining the coast and islands of Lee County; all U.S. territorial waters adjoining the coast and islands and all connected bays, estuaries , and rivers from Gordon's Pass, near Naples, Collier County, southward to and including Whitewater Bay, Monroe County; all waters of Card, Barnes, Blackwater, Little Blackwater, Manatee, and Buttonwood Sounds between Key Largo, Monroe County, and the mainland of Dade County; Biscayne Bay, and all adjoining and connected lakes, rivers, canals, and waterways from the southern tip of Key Biscayne northward to and including Maule Lake, Dade County; all of Lake Worth, from its northernmost point immediately south of the intersection of U.S. Highway 1 and Florida State Highway A1A southward to its southernmost point immediately north of the town of Boynton Beach, Palm Beach County; the Loxahatchee River and its headwaters, Martin and West Palm Beach Counties; that section of the intracoastal waterway from the town of Seawalls Point, Martin County to Jupiter Inlet, Palm Beach County; the entire inland section of water known as the Indian River, from its northernmost point immediately south of the intersection of U.S. Highway I and Florida State Highway 3, Volusia County, southward to its southernmost point near the town of Sewalls Point, Martin County, and the entire inland section of water known as the Banana River and allwaterways between Indian and Banana Rivers, Brevard County; the St. Johns River including Lake George, and including Blue Springs and Silver Glen Springs from their points of origin to their confluences with the St. Johns River; that section of the Intracoastal Waterway from its confluences with the St. Marys River on the Georgia-Florida border to the Florida State Highway A1A bridge south of Coastal City, Nassau and Duval Counties.
