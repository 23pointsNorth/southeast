- **Taxon:** Fish
- **Range:** Upper Little Red River drainage of north-central Arkansas
- **Status:** [Listed as endangered on Sept. 8, 2011](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-09/pdf/2011-20018.pdf)

The yellowcheek darter, *Etheostoma moorei*, is a member of the darter subgenus *Nothonotus*, with a very restricted range in the upper Little Red River drainage of north-central Arkansas.   Impoundment and habitat destruction have significantly reduced the known range and populations of this Arkansas endemic.

Spawning occurs late May through June in cobble or gravel riffles. During spawning, female yellowcheeks bury themselves in fine gravel/sand substrates (often behind large cobble or boulders) with only their heads and caudal fin exposed. A male yellowcheek will then position himself above the buried female and fertilize her eggs as she releases them into the substrate in a vibrating motion. Clutch size and nest defense behavior is unknown. Typical yellowcheek darter lifespan is four to five years, and they obtain a maximum body length of approximately 3 inches.

## Appearance

The yellowcheek darter is a small and laterally-compressed fish that attains a maximum standard length of about 2.5 in, and has a moderately sharp snout, deep body, and deep caudal peduncle. The back and sides are grayish brown, often with darker brown saddles and lateral bars. Breeding males are brightly colored with a bright blue or brilliant turquoise throat and breast and a light-green belly, while breeding females possess orange and red-orange spots but are not brightly colored.

## Habitat

The yellowcheek darter inhabits high-gradient headwater tributaries with clear water, permanent flow, moderate to strong riffles, and gravel, cobble, and boulder substrates (Robison and Buchanan 1988). Yellowcheeks require clear water with high oxygen content and are rarely found in pools or slow moving water.

## Diet

Yellowcheek darters prefer black fly larvae as their main dietary item but also consume mayflies, stoneflies, and other aquatic insect species.

## Historic range

Yellowcheek darters historically inhabited tributaries of the Little Red River, including Archey Creek, Devil’s Fork, South Fork, Middle Fork, Turkey Creek, and Beech Fork.  They are believed to have interacted to create a single yellowcheek darter metapopulation.

## Current range

Damming of the Little Red River at Greers Ferry in 1964 fragmented continuous riverine habitat, reduced the species distribution, and created four independent populations of yellowcheek darters.  Current distribution is still the four tributaries of the upper Little Red River: Devil’s Fork (including the Turkey Creek and Beech Fork segments), the Middle Fork, South Fork, and Archey Creek. However, a smaller portion of these tributaries are occupied compared to historical distributions.

## Conservation challenges

Yellowcheek populations have declined drastically over the last 20 years (from 60,000 to less than 10,000 total individuals); continued survival of the species is of great concern. Reduced stream flows are one likely cause of the decline of the yellowcheek and have resulted in a downstream range constriction of populations on all four streams inhabited by the darter. 
Human activities within streams and on lands bordering streams have cumulative negative effects on yellowcheek populations. Threats include improper timber harvest (especially within stream riparian areas), unregulated gravel mining, unrestricted cattle access into streams, water withdrawal for agricultural or other purposes, and both point and non-point source pollution arising from a broad array of human activities.

## Recovery plan

Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Service prepares recovery plans for species listed as endangered or threatened. The goal of the recovery plan is to ensure the long-term viability of the yellowcheek darter in the wild to the point that it can be removed from the endangered species list.

### Recovery criteria

For the yellowcheek darter to be considered as recovered, the following criteria must be met:

1. Water quality and quantity in the Middle, South and either Archey or Devils Forks , as defined by the best available science (to be refined by recovery actions), supports the long-term survival of yellowcheek darter in its natural environment (based on Safe Harbor enrollment and private landowner conservation efforts);
2. streams where the yellowcheek darter occurs contain geomorphically stable channels with relatively silt-free, moderate to strong velocity riffles with gravel cobble and boulder substrates that support adequate macroinvertebrate prey items, as defined by reference stream conditions in the Boston Mountain ecoregion.
3. healthy, self-sustaining (evident by multiple age classes of individuals, including naturally recruited juveniles, and recruitment rates exceeding mortality rates) natural populations of yellowcheek darters, as defined by the best available science (to be refined by recovery actions), are maintained in three of four tributaries (Middle, South, and either Archey or Devils Forks) at stable or increasing levels during a 30-year period (trend based on surveys conducted every three years via standard protocol and incorporating species recovery period from extreme droughts); and
4. a captive propagation, augmentation and reintroduction plan has been established, and a contingency plan is in place to ensure the survival of the species should a catastrophic event affect portions of a wild population.

The measures mentioned above have been realized and demonstrated effective via monitoring efforts.
Commitments are in place to maintain conservation measures and recovered status. [Download the 2018 recovery plan](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/Final%202018%20Yellowcheek%20darter%20RP_1.pdf).

## How you can help

Reduce sedimentation and nutrification in the Little Red River watershed through implementation of BMPs. Safe Harbor Agreements and Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances are available to landowners in the upper Little Red River watershed who implement land management practices that promote species recovery.
