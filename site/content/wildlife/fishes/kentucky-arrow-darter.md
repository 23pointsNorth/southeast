## Appearance
Kentucky arrow darters are small members of the perch family of fish, growing a little longer than 4.5 inches. They thrive in shallow water and spawn just 6 inches from the surface. Like most arrow darters, but unlike most other fish species, males defend their nests. They establish their territories and defend their eggs until theyâ€™ve hatched.

During spawning season, males become quite vibrant in color as the species dash around shallow water in an elaborate mating ritual. Historically found in at least 74 streams in the upper Kentucky River, surveys conducted in 2006 were only able to document them in 47 streams.

## Habitat
Kentucky arrow darters can be found in pools or transitional areas between riffles and pools in moderate to high gradient, small to medium streams with rocky substrates. The species is often found near cover such as boulders, rock ledges, large cobble, or woody debris.

## Diet
Kentucky arrow darters feed primarily on mayflies, larval blackflies, and midges, with lesser amounts of caddisfly larvae, stonefly nymphs, and beetle larvae. Kentucky arrow darters greater than 70 mm (2.8 in) often feed on small crayfishes.

## Historic Range
The Kentucky arrow darter occurred historically in at least 74 streams in the upper Kentucky River basin of eastern Kentucky that spanned portions of 6 smaller sub-basins or watersheds: North Fork Kentucky River, Middle Fork Kentucky River, South Fork Kentucky River, Silver Creek, Sturgeon Creek, and Red River. A detailed description of the historical records and their sources can be found in the [2015 Proposed Listing Rule](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-10-08/pdf/2015-25278.pdf).

## Current Range
Based on surveys completed since 2006, populations of the Kentucky arrow darter can be found in 47 streams across the upper Kentucky River basin in eastern Kentucky. These populations are scattered across 6 sub-basins: North Fork Kentucky River, Middle Fork Kentucky River, South Fork Kentucky River, Silver Creek, Sturgeon Creek, and Red River.

Current populations occur in the following Kentucky River watersheds:

- North Fork Kentucky River: Troublesome, Quicksand, Frozen, Holly, Lower Devil, Walker, and Hell Creek watersheds
- Middle Fork Kentucky River: Big Laurel, Rockhouse, Hell For Certain Creek, and Squabble Creek watersheds
- South Fork Kentucky River: Red Bird River, Hector Branch, and Goose, Bullskin, Buffalo, and Lower Buffalo Creek watersheds
- Silver Creek: Silver Creek
- Sturgeon Creek: Travis, Wild Dog, and Granny Dismal Creek watersheds
- Red River: Rock Bridge Fork of Swift Camp Creek

## Conservation Challenges
Habitat for the Kentucky arrow darter has been severely degraded by water pollution and sedimentation originating from surface coal mining, oil and gas exploration activities, residential area development, stream channelization, and deforestation.

## Recovery Plan
This species is not currently listed under the Endangered Species Act, therefore it does not have a recovery plan.
