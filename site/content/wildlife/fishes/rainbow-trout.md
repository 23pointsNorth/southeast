- **Taxon: Fish**
- **Range: In the Southeast the rainbow trout can be found in [Alabama](/alabama), [Arkansas](/arkansas), [Georgia](/georgia), [Kentucky](/kentucky), [Louisiana](/louisiana), [Mississippi](/mississippi), [North Carolina](/north-carolina), [South Carolina](/south-carolina), and [Tennessee](/tennessee)**
- **Status: Not Listed**

Rainbow trout are coldwater fish that have long been symbolic of clear, healthy mountain streams and lakes in North America. Because of their ability to thrive in hatcheries and their popularity as a game fish, they have been introduced into streams and lakes all over North America as well as every continent except Antarctica.

## News and Events

## Appearance

While coloration varies widely between regions and subspecies, adult fish have a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most pronounced in breeding males. The caudal fin is squarish and only mildly forked. Lake-dwelling and anadromous forms are usually more silvery in color with the reddish stripe almost completely gone. Juvenile rainbow trout display parr marks (dark vertical bars) typical of most salmonid juveniles. In some redband and golden trout forms parr marks are typically retained into adulthood.

## Habitat

Cold tailwaters below dams, creeks, small to large rivers, cool lakes, estuaries, and oceans comprise the habitats collectively used by the different populations of rainbow trout. Depending on the genetic makeup of a trout population and habitat conditions, rainbow trout will use some or all of these aquatic habitats during their lives. Prime trout waters are clear, clean, and cold. A good trout stream habitat is complex, consisting of an array of riffles and pools, submerged wood, boulders, undercut banks, and aquatic vegetation.

## Diet

Rainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture.Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in freshwater, routinely feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects. They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations.

## Historic Range

The historic range of Rainbow trout extends from Alaska to Mexico and includes parts of Canada and the western United States. Steelhead, an anadromous form of Rainbow trout, migrate as juveniles to saltwater and return to freshwater to lay their eggs.

## Current Range

Outside of its historic range Rainbow trout have been introduced throughout the world. Introductions include the Great lakes region, south central Canada, portions of the Great Plain states east of the Rocky mountains and southwestern Mexico. Rainbows have been introduced into cold tailwaters below dams in many southern states. These fish were to provide sport-fishing opportunity and to mitigate for the loss of warm water sportfish. Populations of this species can be found in waters on all continents except Antarctica. Its range extends from the Arctic circle to the Equator (Ecuador, Kenya, Uganda) in the Northern Hemisphere, and from the Equator to  southern Argentina in the Southern Hemisphere. Because the rainbow trout is sensitive to warm temperatures it cannot survive naturally in many of these environments and is therefore reintroduced repeatedly in order to support sport fishing.
