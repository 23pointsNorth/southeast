The alligator gar is the largest of seven species of gar found in North America, Central America, and Cuba. The species is sometimes referred to as a living fossil because scientists can trace them in the fossil record back 100 million years. Alligator gar are euryhaline, which means they’re able to survive in fresh and salty waters. In addition to gills, alligator gar have a swim bladder connected to their gut which allows them to gulp air and live in water that is low in oxygen.

The largest alligator gar on record, weighing in at 327 pounds and stretching 8ft 5 ¼ inches in length, came from an oxbow lake on the Mississippi River on Feb. 14, 2011. Historic observations and photographs suggest alligator gar can reach weights and lengths of up to 350 pounds and up to 10 feet in length.

Alligator gar were once found across most large river systems and tributaries of the Gulf of Mexico upstream to the Ohio River Valley. Alligator gar prefer large rivers with a large overflow floodplain, which have all but disappeared in North America due to river dredging and the construction of dams, dikes, and levees.

Recent surveys suggest populations are far below historic levels and could be declining further. Alligator gar have been identified as an imperiled species by the American Fisheries Society and a focal species of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Numerous states have already or are in the process of increasing conservation and management through regulations, habitat restoration, and stocking.

## Appearance

All gars have an elongated, torpedo-shaped body and are often confused with other more commonly encountered gar species due to their similarity of appearance to the untrained eye. They are heavier and have a broader body, a short, broad snout, and numerous large teeth. Alligator gar have two rows of teeth on the upper jaw. The caudal fin is not symmetrical. The dorsal and anal fins are located very far back on the body. Gar bodies are covered by thick overlapping scales that create a protective covering similar to medieval chainmail.

Their coloration is dark olive green dorsally, fading to gray-white sides and white ventrally. The scales are dotted mid-dorsally with varying camouflaging shades mixing between black and light colored golden-white spots. Larvae and juveniles have a light colored stripe or spots linearly along the dorsal line which fade with growth through the first few weeks of life resulting in a solid dark green or olive dorsal appearance. Within the first few months they have black and dark green spots, bands, and blotches laterally and their bodies are more olive-bronze or golden colored dorsally with silvery white gill plates and lower jaw.

## Habitat and ecology

Populations of alligator gar have vanished from much of their historical range as a result of habitat destruction, indiscriminate culling, and unrestricted harvests. Populations are now found primarily in the Southern United States extending into Mexico. They can adapt to waters  ranging from freshwater lakes and swamps to brackish marshes, estuaries, and bays along the Gulf of Mexico.

The alligator gar is the most tolerant gar species of high salinity and occasionally strays into salt water. They have been found to congregate in high densities at certain locations for pre-spawn staging (typically April-May), spawning (typically April-June), and during winter (December-February).

Spawning usually occurs when water temperatures reach approximately 23° C. Females carry an average of 138,000 eggs. A female flanked by several males will deposit eggs on vegetation. The fertilized eggs are adhesive and will firmly stick to the vegetation. Eggs usually hatch within 48-72 hours after the spawn. Larvae remain attached to vegetation via a suctorial disc for several days. During the final stages of egg yolk absorption, the larvae will detach and begin to search for food five  to 10 days after hatching.

Eggs and yolk sacs have been found to be extremely toxic to crustaceans and vertebrates other than teleost fishes, presumably as a defense mechanism. Crayfish and blue crabs, in particular, are susceptible to the toxin. Humans are also susceptible and should not eat or even handle the eggs without taking proper precautions.

Growth rates of young fish are extremely fast, and it is not uncommon for a fish to attain 10-12 inches in size within the first year.

It is not known whether they are migratory.

## Diet

Alligator gar are relatively passive, seemingly sluggish, solitary fish, but voracious ambush predators. They are opportunistic night predators and are primarily piscivores, but they will also ambush and eat waterfowl and small mammals that may be floating on the surface. Their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach. They lunge forward, and with a sweeping motion grab their prey, impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth.

They occasionally ingest sports fish, but studies suggest they feed predominantly on forage fishes such as gizzard shad, as well as invertebrates and waterfowl. Diet studies have also revealed fishing tackle and boat engine parts in their stomachs.

Juveniles feed on plankton, invertebrates, amphibians, and fish before transitioning to almost exclusively fish. They stay near the surface utilizing floating straw, grasses, and debris for cover, while in the later months of the first year they remain in the deeper water and primarily only approach the surface for supplemental air and feeding at night.

## Historical range

Alligator gar historically inhabited waters and tributaries throughout the Mississippi River Valley from Ohio to Illinois and downstream into the estuary waters of the Gulf of Mexico. They may have been found as far north as Iowa and as far west as Kansas and Nebraska.

## Current range

Known populations of alligator gar currently exist only in the lower Mississippi River Valley from Oklahoma to the west, from Arkansas to the north, from Texas and portions of Mexico to the south, and east to Florida.

## Conservation challenges

Alligator gar were once abundant in many watersheds but are now difficult to find. Possible reasons for their decline include habitat loss resulting from navigation, flood control alteration of streams and floodplains, and over-harvesting. They were considered in some places a highly sought after sportfish, but mostly they were considered a "trash fish" and were targeted for eradication or control. Studies in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana have shown that the alligator gar is very susceptible to overfishing. It has been classified by  states as rare in Missouri, threatened in Illinois, and endangered in Arkansas, Kentucky, and is soon to be in Tennessee.

The alligator gar has been commercially fished in Southern states along with other gar species, and has also been fished and bow-fished.

## Propagation

Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery participates in the alligator gar restoration program, which covers the Mobile River Basin in Alabama and the Mississippi River Basin in Tennessee.  Our stocking efforts are directed to the Hatchie River, a tributary of the Mississippi River in Tennessee where the alligator gar is state listed as critically imperiled. Alligator gar were sampled, tagged and distributed in July of 2018. 2,642 gar were released totalling almost 100 pounds with an average length of 6” and 16.8 grams each.

### Future work

- Provide assistance to biologists from [Private John Allen National Fish Hatchery](/private-john-allen) and Alabama DCNR with broodfish collection, spawning, and research.
- Refine feeding protocols to include various forms of artificial feed.
- Produce an alligator gar culture manual that can be disseminated to other stations.
- Run fertilization trials using cryopreserved sperm to finalize protocols for short-term and cryopreservation storage of alligator gar sperm.

## How you can help

- Help identify and report locations or sightings of live, dead, captured, and/or tagged alligator gar.
- Practice catch and release of netted or hooked gar and only take or shoot gar for food as necessary.
- Respect spawning periods from April through July and reduce the potential for take or disturbance by avoiding take of large gar in shallow - waters and sport shooting.
- Educate fellow recreational, commercial, and bowfishers of the conservation status, ethics, regulations, and laws for protecting and - conserving this important species.
- Develop tournament and club rules to assist in conservation.
- Contact the Service or Arkansas Game & Fish Commission for assistance or questions.
