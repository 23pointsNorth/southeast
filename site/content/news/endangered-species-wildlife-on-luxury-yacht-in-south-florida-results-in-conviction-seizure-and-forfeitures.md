MIAMI, FL -- R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida; Anthony V. Mangione, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Investigations; James Gale, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS), Southeast Region, and Harold Woodward, Director of Field Operations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced that Ruzial, Ltd. (Ruzial), a Cayman Islands corporation, pled guilty on May 11, 2009 to felony charges of attempting to import and thereafter transport approximately twenty-nine (29) wildlife items that included specimens of various protected species, knowing that the wildlife was transported and possessed in violation of the laws, treaties, and regulations of the U.S., specifically, the Endangered Species Act, all in violation of the federal Lacey Act following an ICE and FWS investigation.

U.S. District Court Judge William P. Dimitrouleas accepted Ruzial’s plea and adjudicated the company guilty. After conducting a hearing on the matter, Judge Dimitrouleas imposed the sentence on the corporation. The Judge ordered Ruzial to pay a criminal fine of $50,000, payable to the Lacey Act Reward Fund established pursuant to Title 16, United States Code, Section 3375, and administered by the Secretary of the Interior. In addition, the Court ordered Ruzial to pay $100,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a Congressionally-chartered organization authorized by law to receive payments arising as a result of criminal convictions. Finally, Judge Dimitrouleas ordered Ruzial to forfeit to the U.S. the 29 items of contraband wildlife, which include specimens of reticulated python (_Python reticulatus_), anaconda (_Eunectes spp._), ivory of extant species of elephants (_Loxodonta africana / Elephas maximus_), tiger (_Panthera tigris_), leopard (_Panthera pardus_), jaguar(_Panthera onca_), Hartman’s zebra (_Equus zebra hartmannae_), and lion (_Panthera leo_).

According to statements made in Court and records filed in the case, on December 18, 2007, the vessel _M/Y MYSTERE C. I._, registered in the Cayman Islands, made entry into the U.S. at Port Everglades in Broward County, Florida from Italy, via Spain, as cargo aboard the transport vessel _Enterprise_. The registered owner of the _M/Y MYSTERE_ is the defendant Ruzial. Inspection of the _M/Y MYSTERE C. I._ by CBP specialists, wildlife inspectors and special agents of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) confirmed the presence on board of numerous wildlife items protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna & Flora (CITES).

These items, including elephant ivory, stuffed tigers, wild feline skins, and snake skin, are required by federal regulations to be declared upon importation to the U.S. to both CBP and FWS, and to be accompanied by appropriate CITES permits. Some of the regulated items were installed as fixtures on the vessel, while others were placed about the vessel as decoration. ICE special agents determined that the required declarations of the various items was not made to the CBP and FWS. Additionally, the wildlife items were not accompanied by CITES export or re-export permits, or equivalent documents, from their countries of natal origin or re-export.

After an initial field identification, specimens from many of the protected animals confiscated in this case were sent to the National Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon, an international leader in wildlife forensics, for genetic identification to confirm their protected status under U.S. law and the CITES Convention. The contraband wildlife is conservatively valued at over $85,000.

The Lacey Act protects both plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for a wide array of violations. The Act also prohibits the falsification of documents for most shipments of wildlife (a criminal penalty) and prohibits the failure to mark wildlife shipments (civil penalty).

U.S. Attorney Acosta said, “The Lacey Act, a federal statute dating back more than 100 years, underscores other federal, state, and foreign laws protecting wildlife by making it a separate offense to take, possess, transport, or sell wildlife taken in violation of those laws. We will continue to enforce criminal and civil violations of the Lacey Act to protect our endangered species from profiteers and poachers.”

“The illegal trade in endangered wildlife robs directly from our future and the futures of our children and our grandchildren,” said SAC Mangione. “It robs them of the opportunity to see these creatures in their natural environment. People who engage in this type of activity are criminals, and we will work with our law enforcement partners to ensure that they are brought to justice.”

“When a person brings protected wildlife – like ivory, leopard skins, tiger skins, and reticulated python snake skins – into our country without following the rules, there are consequences,” said SAC Gale. “We are proud of the coordinated investigative work of our agents with their colleagues from ICE and CBP. Using a significant portion of this fine to raise awareness about those rules is the right thing to do as we work to promote the conservation of wildlife here and abroad.”

“U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and Agriculture specialists actively search for prohibited items manufactured at the expense of an endangered species,” said Director Woodward. “The illegal importation and collection of these items contributes to their extinction and deprives us all. This seizure is an excellent example of how U. S. Customs and Border Protection is working with our partners in law enforcement to prevent these products from entering the United States.”

The $100,000 payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation will be employed by the Foundation, with the assistance of the Fish & Wildlife Service and other interested federal agencies, to construct and install public information displays in the Southern District of Florida at selected international airports and international embarkation facilities for passengers departing the U.S., in order to acquaint them with the restrictions placed by domestic and international law on the trade and transportation of protected species.

Mr. Acosta commended the coordinated investigative efforts of ICE, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and CBP for their work on this matter.

This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Watts-FitzGerald.
