The US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) are planning to Reintroduce Puerto Rican Parrots at a third site in Puerto Rico. To select a site and meet the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements for this proposed action, we will prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) considering site alternatives proposed, evaluated, and discussed among concerned agencies. At this time, the Maricao State Forest, in Maricao, San German and Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico is the preferred alternative.

The EA will take one year to complete as we gather the necessary additional data to fully understand the potential for species interaction and management activities that would be needed at the selected third location.

Establishing additional populations in the wild is a pivotal recovery action outlined in the Recovery Plan for the Puerto Rican Parrot. With a third wild population in Puerto Rico we will minimize the species’ risk of extinction and foster its recovery because it is unlikely that catastrophic events (e.g., hurricanes), and other threats (e.g., predation), will affect equally all three locations.

The public has an important role to play in this process. The Service is seeking comments, suggestions, and information regarding this proposed project. You are invited to respond by September 9, 2011. Responses, including names and addresses, received by that date will be used in the Environmental Assessment and will be considered part of the public record on this proposed action and will be available for public inspection. Comments should be sent to: Marisel López Flores, Project Leader, Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Program, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, PO Box 1600, Rio Grande, Puerto Rico 00745, 787-887-8769 x 224 or 787-240-8895 or via e-mail to: [marisel_lopez@fws.gov](mailto:marisel_lopez@fws.gov).
