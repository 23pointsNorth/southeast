The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service invites student artists to submit artwork for the 2010 Junior Duck Stamp competition. Entries must be postmarked by March 15, 2010.

The Georgia Junior Duck Stamp competition recognizes Georgia’s top student waterfowl artists. Public, private, home-schooled and art studio students from kindergarten through high school are invited to compete for recognition, prizes and scholarships in an activity that promotes the conservation of America’s wetlands and waterfowl habitat.

Visit [fws.gov/juniorduck/](https://www.fws.gov/juniorduck/) for 2010 contest information, rules, list of eligible species, entry requirements, contest rules, entry forms and waterfowl curriculum.

Each year, hundreds of Georgia students compete to win these top honors. Teachers can use an integrated science and art curriculum provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Each participating student must research and then artistically portray a duck, goose, or other waterfowl species native to North America on paper. All artwork submitted must be an original 9” x 12” horizontal image of North American ducks, geese or swans. All participants receive a certificate of appreciation.

All artwork with attached official entry and reference forms should be mailed to the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Program, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1875 Century Boulevard, Suite 240, Atlanta, Georgia, 30345, and must be postmarked by midnight March 15, 2010, to be eligible. Additional contest information and an official entry form can be obtained by calling Resee Collins, Georgia Coordinator, at (404) 314-6526 or online at [fws.gov/juniorduck/EntryPacket.htm](https://www.fws.gov/juniorduck/EntryPacket.htm).

The 2010 Georgia contest judging will take place at the Atlanta U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Office on Tuesday, March 30, 2010\. A total of 100 winners and (1) Best of Show will be selected from the four different age groups. The Best of Show will be sent on to compete nationally in Washington D.C. The national First Place entry is then used as the Federal Junior Duck Stamp, which is sold by the U.S Postal Service and Amplex Corporation for $5 per stamp. Proceeds from the sale of Junior Duck Stamps support conservation education and provide awards and scholarships for the students, teachers and schools that participate in the program.

The Georgia 2010 winning artwork will tour the state of Georgia on public exhibit at venues ranging from Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain, Elachee Nature Center in Gainesville, and the Macon Museum of Arts and Sciences.

Georgia’s Junior Duck Stamp competition is part of the Federal Junior Duck Stamp competition, authorized by Congress in 1994\. The purpose of the Junior Duck Stamp contest is to promote conservation of wetlands and waterfowl habitat through arts education. The Junior Duck Stamp is modeled after the Federal Duck Stamp, which has been sold since 1934 to raise money to protect wetlands and waterfowl habitat.
