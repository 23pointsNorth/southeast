The [beaverpond marstonia](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=G029), a tiny snail the size of a pencil eraser, was discovered in 1977 in a creek in South Georgia. It’s been 17 years since it was last seen. Based on the best available information, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is announcing today that the beaverpond marstonia is presumed to be extinct. As a result, the agency will not list the species as endangered or threatened under the [Endangered Species Act](/endangered-species-act) (ESA).

The beaverpond marstonia’s known habitat is limited to portions of four small creeks in Crisp, Worth and Dougherty counties east of Lake Blackshear in south Georgia. Four surveys by scientists were unable to find any of the snails, and many of the creek habitat areas they may once have occupied were dry.

While the Service currently considers the beaverpond marstonia to be extinct, it welcomes any new information concerning the status of the beaverpond marstonia, whenever it becomes available. The Service encourages continued surveys for the beaverpond marstonia as time and funding allows. If the species is subsequently found to exist, the Service will reevaluate its legal status under the ESA in the future.
