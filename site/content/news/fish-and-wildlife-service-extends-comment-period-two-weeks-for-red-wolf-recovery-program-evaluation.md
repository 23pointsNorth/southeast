The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is extending by two weeks the comment period to receive information about the Red Wolf Recovery Program and its non-essential, experimental population of red wolves in Eastern North Carolina.  The deadline to receive comments will be Friday, September 26\.  

Interested individuals may continue to submit comments, concerns, or information to the following e-mail: [redwolfreview@fws.gov](mailto:redwolfreview@fws.gov).  The Service is receiving messages submitted though the system is delaying their delivery leading in some cases to 'undeliverable' messages. 

"As a result of the high interest in this work, the email server for this address is struggling to keep up," said Leopoldo Miranda, the Service's Assistant Regional Director for Ecological Services in Atlanta.  "We are pleased with the interest in this process and the level of feedback we are receiving."

The Service also is encouraging citizens to send comments through regular mail as an alternative to the following address:  Attention:  Red Wolf Evaluation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1875 Century Boulevard, Suite 200, Atlanta, Georgia, 30345\.  Anything postmarked September 26 or earlier will be accepted. 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the principal federal agency responsible for conserving, protecting and enhancing fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.
