**Jamestown, KY** – What began as a small event in 1986 has now blossomed into one of the largest events of its kind in the country.  This year’s 33rd Annual Catch A Rainbow Kids Fishing Derby is scheduled for Saturday, June 1, 2019, at Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery.

Designed as a way to get kids outdoors and connected to fishing, this event provides an opportunity for families to have fun with a rod and reel. Last year’s event included approximately 1,200 participating children. Support and planning for the event came from generous donations of time and aid from more than 100 volunteers and more than 100 sponsors. The event offers fishing, prizes, trophies, food, and much more at no charge.

The derby is hosted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and the Friends of Wolf Creek NFH, Inc. If you would like to make a donation or volunteer to help with the derby, please feel free to contact the Hatchery.  

Wolf Creek NFH improves scientific literacy through nationally recognized formal and non-formal science and conservation education programs.
