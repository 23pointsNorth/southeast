“A March on the Water,” an acrylic painting of a green winged teal by Win Sheng, aged 12, from First Fine Art and Design Studio in Johns Creek, won the 2019 Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Art Competition.  The contest was held last week at the Southeast Regional U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office in Atlanta.
 
“I painted the green winged teal because of all the colors and its personality,” said Win Sheng. He has been painting for only two and a half years.

Win Sheng will receive a $175 scholarship from Georgia Power, a long-time sponsor of the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Program, as well as a certificate and ribbon. As Georgia’s Best of Show, Sheng’s original artwork will be sent to compete in the National Junior Duck Stamp Contest on Friday, April 19, at the Visitors Center of Patuxent Research Refuge in Laurel, Maryland.

A panel of distinguished judges, selected for their expertise in artistic design, wildlife art, and waterfowl biology, decided the Best of Show among the winners of this year’s contest. They were Greg Balkcom, wildlife biologist, Georgia Department of Natural Resources; Ben Dickerson, Georgia Power; David Patterson, former Georgia Junior Duck First Place and Second Place winning artist, Dean Demarest, deputy chief of Migratory Birds in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Southeast Region; and Darwin Huggins retired assistant special agent-in charge for the Office of Law Enforcement in the Service’s Southeast Region.

A total of 100 winners were selected.  They included up to 25 winners in each of four different age groups:  Kindergarten to third grade, fourth to sixth grade, seventh to ninth grade and 10th to 12th grade.  There were three first place, three second place, three third place and up to 16 honorable mention winners were chosen in each of the four categories. The Best of Show was selected from among all of the first place winners.

This year, 581 Junior Duck Stamp entries of 52 different species were submitted statewide from 13 different public and private schools, home schools, and art studios.

Prizes and ribbons also were given for the best student conservation message that expresses the spirit of what they learned while researching and planning for their Duck Stamp Contest artwork entry. This year’s winning conservation message was submitted by 16-year-old Aastha Jaiswal of Griffin Christian Schools: “Conserve the Earth, Ensure Our Future.”
