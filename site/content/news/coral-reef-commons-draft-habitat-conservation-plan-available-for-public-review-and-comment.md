**Vero Beach, Florida** – The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking public comments on a developer’s plan to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts to eight threatened, endangered, and at-risk species in Miami-Dade County. The plan is part of a process to clear the way for construction to begin on a 137-acre residential and commercial project in south Miami.

Public comments will be considered on the draft Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and associated Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed Coral Reef Commons development over the next 60 days. A final decision to issue incidental take permit (ITP) to the applicants will follow.

The ITP would cover Bartram’s scrub-hairstreak butterfly, Florida leafwing butterfly, Florida bonneted bat, eastern indigo snake, rim rock crowned snake, gopher tortoise, Miami tiger beetle and white-crowned pigeon.

The draft HCP includes commitments to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts, including on-site habitat management to maintain the covered species, as well as protection and management of off-site restoration lands to benefit the covered species. Several measures, such as controlled burns, are designed to conserve listed plants in the area that are not included in the ITP. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) doesn’t require take authorization for listed plants on private property.

The HCP is a flexible tool that is part of an application for an ITP from the Service available through the ESA. The duration requested for this permit is 30 years from the date of issuance.

The EA is required by the National Environmental Policy Act and briefly discusses the purpose and need for this action, alternatives to the action, and provides evidence and analysis of impacts to determine whether to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement or Finding of No Significant Impact.

The applicants for this HCP include Coral Reef Retail LLC, Coral Reef Resi Ph I LLC, Ramdev LLC, and the University of Miami. The Coral Reef Commons Project includes 137.9 acres of a proposed mixed-use development (residential and commercial), including 55.29 acres of on-site mitigation on the CRC Property, as well as 50.96 acres of off-site mitigation, for a total of 106.25 acres of mitigation.
