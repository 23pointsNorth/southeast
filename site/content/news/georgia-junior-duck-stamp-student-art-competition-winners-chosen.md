Bethany Panhorst, 17, from Savannah Arts Academy, Savannah is the winner of the annual 2014 Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Art Competition held April 8, 2014, in Atlanta, Georgia.  Five judges unanimously selected Bethany’s acrylic rendition of a green-winged teal out of 588 total entries as the Georgia Best of Show. 

Ms. Panhorst will receive a $250 scholarship from Georgia Power, a long-time sponsor of the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Program, as well as additional prizes.  As Georgia’s Best of Show, her original artwork will be sent to compete in the national Junior Duck Stamp Competition being held Friday, April 18, at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Conservation Training Center in Sheperdstown, West Virginia. 

This was Bethany’s first duck painting completed in oil and her first submission to the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Contest.

“It took me probably over 20 hours to paint this duck. I chose this species because it was so small and cute”, said Bethany, when notified today by Carmen Simonton, Georgia Junior Duck Contest Coordinator, that she was the Best of Show winner.

This year, 588 Junior Duck Stamp entries were submitted from 20 different public and private schools, home schools, art studios, and after-school programs statewide.  Bethany Panhorst’s winning entry was submitted through Art Teacher Steve Schetski from Savannah Arts Academy.  This is the third time in four years that one of Schetski’s students has been selected as the “Best of Show” in the state competition.
