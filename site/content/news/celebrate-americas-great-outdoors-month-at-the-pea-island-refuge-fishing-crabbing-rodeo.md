Come join your friends and neighbors for the annual Fishing/Crabbing Rodeo on Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge on Saturday, June 10 from 9 am to noon.  This is one of the most looked-forward-to annual events for families on the Outer Banks.  Don't miss it!

The Rodeo is a great way to introduce a child, relative, or friend to the fun activities of crabbing and fishing. This is the only day that North Pond, directly behind the Pea Island Visitor Center, is open to the public for crabbing and fishing. Participants may drive around the service road to a specified end point making this a great way for people to have easy access to North Pond.

"Though one of the focuses for this day is family fun in the great outdoors, the extra access allowed at North Pond on Saturday is strictly for fishing and crabbing.  The pond will continue to be closed to paddling and other activities. We hope folks will come out and enjoy a morning of outdoor recreation on one of the most awesome national wildlife refuges in the whole system,” said Cindy Heffley, Visitor Services Specialist. "We invite all participants to bring crab nets, fishing lines, rods, bait, tackle, and whatever else they think will help them have a memorable day. Everyone will receive a flyer with crabbing regulations and must abide by these regulations."  The event ends promptly at noon.

For more details or questions, please give Cindy a call at 252-475-4180.
