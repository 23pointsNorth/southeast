The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to conduct five-year status reviews of 15 endangered species in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

These five-year reviews are conducted to ensure that listing classifications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are accurate. Any interested party is invited to provide information and comments pertaining to these species. Written comments and information related to these five-year reviews must be received on or before June 8, 2010.

This notice covers the following 15 species federally listed as endangered:

 - [Bariaco](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=1576)
 - [Capá rosa](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=Q26J)
 - [Chamaecrista glandulosa var mirabilis](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=2864)
 - [Vahl’s boxwood or diablito de tres cuernos](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=4454)
 - [Myrcia paganii](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=Q2Q6)
 - [palo de Ramón](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=8113)
 - [Puerto Rican nightjar or guabairo](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=6972)

Specifically, this review seeks information on: (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes, identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list, and improved analytical methods. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans and other actions under the ESA.

The Federal Register notice announcing the status review of these [15 federally listed species is available online](http://www.fws.gov/policy/frsystem/title.cfm?title=Endangered%20and%20Threatened%20Wildlife%20and%20Plants&amp;doc_type=notices&amp;date=10).

Written comments and information on any of these species may be faxed to 787/851-7440, or sent via regular mail to Marelisa Rivera, Caribbean Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 491, Boquerón, Puerto Rico, 00622.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the principal federal agency responsible for conserving, protecting and enhancing fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.
