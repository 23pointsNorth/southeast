The 10<sup>th</sup> annual national Endangered Species Day will be celebrated May 15, 2015, with special events and programs that recognize our nation’s efforts to conserve and protect America’s most imperiled species.

“For more than 40 years, the Endangered Species Act has played a critical role in protecting and conserving America’s threatened, endangered and at-risk species,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe. “Endangered Species Day honors those who uphold the legacy of the Act while inspiring the next generation of conservation leaders.”

“As Americans, we walk the talk when it comes to protecting imperiled wildlife—from bald eagles to black-footed ferrets,” said Leda Huta, Executive Director of the Endangered Species Coalition, primary sponsor of Endangered Species Day. “Our country’s 99 percent success rate at preventing extinction is worth celebrating. And during Endangered Species Day we do just that around the country.”

National wildlife refuges, parks, botanical gardens, schools, libraries, museums, community groups and conservation organizations will hold various activities on Endangered Species Day and throughout the month. This year’s events range throughout the country and include the Endangered Species Day festival at the U.S. Botanic Garden in Washington, D.C., events at our country’s iconic parks, such as Yosemite and Grand Canyon National Parks, habitat restoration projects in California, New Mexico, Oregon, Colorado and Wisconsin, and special programs at more than 100 zoos and aquariums across the country.

“AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums are dedicated to providing exceptional care to animals, as well as working to save species in their natural ranges,” said AZA President & CEO Jim Maddy. “AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums support more than 2,450 conservation projects in 127 countries, contributing more than $160 million to wildlife conservation projects, but many species continue to face threats such as habitat loss and poaching. It is extremely important for conservation organizations to work together to raise awareness and impact change. As partners in Endangered Species Day, AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums are working to engage visitors in learning about conservation issues affecting endangered species and what we can all do to help protect their future.”

Started in 2006 by the U.S. Senate, Endangered Species Day is a celebration of our nation’s imperiled plants, wildlife and wild places, with an emphasis on success stories of species recovery. Co-administered by the Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the purpose of the Act is to conserve imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend. Since its inception, the Endangered Species Act has prevented hundreds of listed species from going extinct.
