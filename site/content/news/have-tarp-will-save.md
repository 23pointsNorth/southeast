Surely you’ve seen it? The stranded manatee that was in the wrong place when Sarasota Bay suddenly went dry?
 
To recap: Hurricane Irma’s winds were so powerful as the storm headed north Sunday along Florida’s west coast that it pushed water out of bays. People accustomed to looking over glistening expanses of salt water suddenly saw grassy flats.
 
And, on Sarasota Bay, some saw two helpless creatures – manatees. The bay had emptied so suddenly the animals were stuck.
 
One man took a photo of a hapless manatee. Flat on its massive stomach, it turned a wrinkled, unhappy face to his camera. Click! The world has seen its grimace.
 
Another guy and some friends, admittedly “stir crazy,” were driving along the bay and saw the two creatures, too.
 
Marcelo Clavijo went to Facebook to describe what happened next:
 
“[T]he tide was sucking the bay dry which stranded two manatees on the flats, …” he wrote.
 
[W]e rolled them on [a] tarp and then dragged them 100 yards,” he continued. “It was crazy.
 
“[N]ow back to the reality of a hurricane coming.”
 
Irma has since come and gone from that part of Florida, and that has given state wildlife officials a few moments to consider the extraordinary moment – strangers on a mission, working fast to save a protected species.
 
Manatees, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, sometimes do get stranded. They can live for some time out of water, said Susan Smith, the commission’s community relations director.
 
In fact, manatees “often show this behavior during mating,” she wrote in an email.
 
So if you see a manatee stranded, regardless of whether it’s having an intimate moment with a fellow manatee, alert the authorities. The commission has a hotline: 1-888-404-3922.
