## Annual Catch A Rainbow Kids Fishing Derby - Saturday, June 2

What began as a small event in 1986 has now blossomed into one of the largest events of its kind in the country! This year’s 32nd Annual Catch A Rainbow Kids Fishing Derby is scheduled for Saturday, June 2, 2018 and will take place at the Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery. 

Designed as a way to get kids outdoors and connected to fishing, this event provides an opportunity for families to have fun with a rod and reel! Last year’s event included approximately 1,500 participating children! Support and planning for the event came about through generous donations of more than a hundred volunteers and over one hundred sponsors. The event offers fishing, prizes, trophies, food, and much more at no charge!

The derby is hosted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and the Friends of Wolf Creek NFH, Inc. If you would like to make a donation or volunteer to help with the derby, please feel free to contact the Hatchery. You can also contact Ashley Buffington or Moria Painter, Environmental Education/Outreach Specialists, at 270-343-3797 or via email: [Ashley_buffington@fws.gov](mailto:Ashley_buffington@fws.gov) or [Moria_painter@fws.gov](mailto:Moria_painter@fws.gov).
