Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar today announced that 41 Native American tribes in 16 states will receive $7 million in competitive federal grants to undertake a wide variety of conservation projects. Funding is provided through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Tribal Wildlife Grants program (TWG), which helps tribes defray the cost of implementing programs on their lands benefiting fish, wildlife, and their habitat.

“Native American tribes manage nearly 100 million acres of land in the United States, land that provides important habitat for some of our nation’s most treasured species. This program provides crucial financial support to tribal governments to help them manage and improve their fish and wildlife heritage for the benefit of all Americans,” said Salazar.

Since its inception in 2003, the competitive Tribal Wildlife Grants program has awarded a total of nearly $50 million to federally recognized Indian Tribes, enabling them to enhance their ability to manage, monitor, and conserve important fish and wildlife resources. Species benefiting from these grants include those of Native American cultural significance, as well as many species not hunted or fished.

This year’s funded projects run the gamut of wildlife conservation activities, from restoring wetlands and other habitat, to conducting traditional wildlife surveys, and from invasive weed management to fishery studies.

The Service received a total of 101 proposals and selected 41 with the highest scores in a uniform ranking process. The maximum award was $200,000.

A state-by-state breakdown of the successful projects and associated tribes is attached.
