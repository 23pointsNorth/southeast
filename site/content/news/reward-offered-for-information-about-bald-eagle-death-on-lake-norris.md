The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency are investigating the death of a bald eagle. The eagle was discovered along the shore of Lake Norris near Point 16 at the end of February, its carcass mutilated and parts removed. A reward of up to $2,500.00 is being offered for information which leads to a conviction of the person or persons responsible for the death of this eagle.

Bald eagles are protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, both federal wildlife statutes. Violations of these statutes carry maximum criminal penalties of up to $100,000 and/or one year in federal prison.

Anyone with information concerning this eagle is asked to call Special Agent Ryan Noel with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement in Knoxville, Tennessee at (865) 692-4024.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the principal federal agency responsible for conserving, protecting and enhancing fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of American people.
