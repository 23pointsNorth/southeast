The Service is helping out in many parts of the Southeast Region. Here are a few examples:

## Alabama

In Daphne, Alabama, Service employees will be giving endangered species talks at local elementary schools with a focus on endangered species recovery and a live gopher tortoise for demonstration.  

## Arkansas

The Arkansas Ecological Services Field Office, in partnership with Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, hosted its eighth annual K-12 art contest focusing on endangered and threatened species found in Arkansas. The Service provides  grade appropriate endangered species teaching materials, and biologists from our office are available to visit classes and talk about our work with listed species throughout the state. This year, the art contest had over 600 entries from 36 schools; entries encompassed 37 of Arkansas' listed species. Entries were judged based on concept, composition, color, and expression by judges from all three agencies. Kitty Harvill, a local artist whose work focuses on nature conservation around the world, was this year's special guest judge. 

Theoverall contest winner  was a mixed-media Ivory Billed Woodpecker by Kenleigh Godwin, a junior at Southside High School in Fort Smith, AR. We also awarded 1st through 3rd place in each of our four age categories. You can view Kenleigh's winning piece and the winners for each age group online at https://www.fws.gov/arkansas-es/esdaywinners2017.html

This year, all 15 winning pieces of artwork are displayed at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's Witt Stephens Jr. Central Arkansas Nature Center in Little Rock as part of their Endangered Species Day celebrations. Artwork will be on display through June 1.
