The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is inviting the public to comment on the proposed establishment of [Green River National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/national-wildlife-refuges/green-river-national-wildlife-refuge/) in Henderson County, Kentucky.

Working at the direction of Congress and in close cooperation with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Service has worked to increase hunter access and conserve important wildlife habitat on approximately 24,000 acres in the proposed refuge. A [draft land protection plan (LPP) and environmental assessment (EA)](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/112180) have been developed in cooperation with partners as part of the process.  Today, the Service is releasing the draft LPP and EA for public review and comment.

The proposed refuge is part of a Conservation Partnership Area, a 53,000-acre expanse. Within that larger boundary, the Service will acquire lands through the purchase of easements and fee title ownership only from willing sellers to create the 24,000-acre Refuge.

The proposed refuge is near the confluence of the Green and Ohio rivers in northwestern Kentucky.  It is valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, supports migrating waterfowl, and will offer recreational opportunities including hunting and fishing.

“This is a win for hunters and anglers,” said Leopoldo “Leo” Miranda, Director of the Service’s Southeast Region, which includes Kentucky. “This refuge also serves as prime wildlife habitat.”

Miranda thanked the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources for its close collaboration on the project. “We couldn’t have done this without their help,” he said.

Conservation of this area is supported by local landowners, conservation groups and state and federal agencies. With its creation, the refuge would join [Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/clarks_river/), located near Benton, the only two refuges located fully in Kentucky.

The Service will hold an informational meeting about the proposed refuge on August 20, 2019, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Preston Arts Center, Henderson Community College, 2660 S. Green St., Henderson, Ky.

The Service welcomes public comment on the draft documents.
