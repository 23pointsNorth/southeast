The Atlantic salt marsh snake and the frosted flatwoods salamander are among 27 federally protected species that will be getting a check-up.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is launching five-year status reviews of 17 endangered species and 10 threatened species occurring in one or more of the 10 states across the Southeast Region and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  The Service is seeking comments and information from the public on all 27 species by November 24, 2014, 60 days from publication in the _Federal Register_.

The reviews will ensure listing classifications under the Endangered Species Act are accurate and reflect the best available information.  In addition to reviewing the classification of each one, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts.  Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.

This notice announces reviews of 17 species currently listed as endangered:

Florida salt marsh vole, Bachman’s warbler, reticulated flatwoods salamander, southern acornshell, ovate clubshell, southern clubshell, upland combshell, triangular kidneyshell, Coosa moccasinshell, dark pigtoe, southern pigtoe, Kentucky cave shrimp, Florida golden aster, Harper’s beauty, scrub lupine, scrub plum, and wide-leaf warea.

This notice also announces the Service’s reviews of 10 species currently listed as threatened: Atlantic salt marsh snake, frosted flatwoods salamander, Alabama heelsplitter, Alabama moccasinshell, orange-nacre mucket, fine-lined pocketbook, Squirrel chimney cave shrimp, palma de manaca, _Geocarpon minimum_ (No common name), and white-haired goldenrod.

Specifically, these  reviews seek information on: (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and, (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods.  Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

The _Federal Register_ notice announcing the status review of these 27 federally listed species is available on-line at [http://www.fws.gov/southeast/news/2014/2014-22594.pdf](http://www.fws.gov/southeast/news/2014/2014-22594.pdf).  Today’s version is the pre-publication draft.  The final version can be viewed in tomorrow’s _Federal Register_, as well as on the above website.
