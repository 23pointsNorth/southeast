The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources are requesting assistance with an investigation involving the unlawful killing of two tundra swans found in south Warren County, Kentucky. Two tundra swans were discovered by a bird watcher on Monday, December 9, 2013, in a ditch beside Old Springfield Road, near the intersection of Oscar Downey Road. Investigators have reason to believe that the swans were killed by a waterfowl hunter on or about December 7th or 8th, likely in a small lake or pond around the Warren, Simpson, and Logan County area.

Anyone with information that directly leads to an arrest or a criminal conviction of the subject or subjects responsible for shooting or transporting the swans may be eligible for a reward of up to $1,000.

Tundra swans are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The maximum criminal penalty for the unlawful taking of migratory birds is six months imprisonment and $15,000 fine per individual.

Anyone with information concerning the killing of the swans is urged to contact Special Agent Bob Snow at (502) 582-5989, ext. 29, or the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources dispatch at 1-800-25-ALERT (800-252-5378).

An unusually large number of tundra swans have migrated to Kentucky this fall and are currently being seen across the state. Many of the places where swans are occurring this winter have never had swans before. Swans in flight appear to be similar to geese and other waterfowl and are likely to be lured to decoy spreads. Waterfowl hunters are reminded that Kentucky, as well as all states included in the Mississippi Flyway, does not have a swan season.
