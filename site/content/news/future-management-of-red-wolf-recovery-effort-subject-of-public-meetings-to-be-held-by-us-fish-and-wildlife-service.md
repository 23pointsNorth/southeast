The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will hold two meetings with residents in Eastern North Carolina to discuss the future management of the non-essential, experimental population of red wolves in five counties there. Everyone within the [red wolf recovery area](/pdf/map/red-wolf-nep.jpg) is encouraged to participate, ask questions and bring ideas to the process.

The meetings are a step in the process for citizens to provide their perspective and comments on an environmental assessment focusing on potential changes to the management of red wolves in the state under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Public input is a key element in moving this process forward. The Service is meeting commitments we have made through the evaluation of the recovery program and how this non-essential, experimental population should be managed. The meetings also represent a step in assessing alternatives and how any proposed changes may affect the red wolf, its future recovery and the people who live, work and play in eastern North Carolina.

The Service will conduct these two scoping meetings to provide the public with additional opportunities to ask questions, discuss aspects of the environmental assessments and NEPA process with Service staff, and provide written or verbal comments.

## Meeting locations

- June 6, 2017, 6:30-8:30 p.m., at Mattamuskeet High School, 20392 US 264, Swan Quarter, NC 27885
- June 8, 2017, 6:30-8:30 p.m., at Coastal North Carolina National Wildlife Refuges Visitor Center, 100 Conservation Way, Manteo, NC  27954

The Service seeks comments and suggestions specifically on:

- The appropriate size and scope of the non-essential, experimental population area;
- Contribution of the non-essential, experimental population to recovery goals for the red wolf;
- Tools for population management;
- Management strategies to address hybridization with coyotes;
- Appropriate provisions for “take” of red wolves; and
- Protocols for red wolves that leave the non-essential, experimental population area, including, but not limited to, requests for removal of animals from private lands.

The meetings and public consideration and review are part of a 60-day process that begins with the publication of a Notice of Intent in the _federal register_ on May 23, 2017, and will continue through July 24, 2017. We will consider all comments on the scope of the draft environmental assessment that are received or postmarked by that date. Comments received or postmarked after that date will be considered to the extent practicable.
