**ATLANTA, GA** - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Sam Hamilton announced today the selection of Cynthia K. Dohner as regional director for the Southeast Region.  

“Cindy is an outstanding choice with a proven track record when it comes to solution-oriented conservation in the Southeast region,” Hamilton said. “She has built a rich career in fish and wildlife conservation with experience that cuts across both the public and private sectors that will benefit us greatly.”  

Dohner, who has been with the Service for 16 years, has served as the deputy regional director since 2004 providing leadership in the daily operations of Service activities in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This includes overseeing the management of 128 national wildlife refuges covering more than 3.2 million acres, 14 national fish hatcheries, five fishery assistance offices, and 17 ecological services field offices.  

Prior to becoming deputy regional director, Dohner was the assistant regional director for ecological services in Atlanta managing more than 325 employees in 16 field offices. She was responsible for implementing numerous programs, such as the Endangered Species Act, Coastal and Partners for Fish and Wildlife programs, Federal water resource development activities and the Environmental Contaminants program. Before coming to the Southeast Region, she worked with the Service’s Division of Fish Hatcheries in Washington, D.C.  

"I am looking forward to working even more closely with our states and other partners in the conservation community here in the Southeast as together we address the unprecedented 21st century challenges to our mission, including the threat of accelerating climate change," Dohner said. "Continuing to build upon these strong, collaborative relationships is critical to our success in conserving landscapes capable of sustaining abundant, diverse and healthy populations of fish, wildlife and plants."  

In this role, she will directly oversee a $484 million budget and more than 1,500 employees.  

Prior to joining the Service, she worked a variety of environmental jobs within the private sector and environmental groups, as well as with a few states and other federal agencies.  

Dohner earned her Bachelor of Science degree in marine biology from the University of Millersville in 1982, and a Masters of Science degree in fisheries and aquaculture from the University of Rhode in 1984.
