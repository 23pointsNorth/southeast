The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is reopening the 60-day public comment period on a proposal to list the white fringeless orchid as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Comments will be accepted through June 13, 2016.  

The Service has determined that legal notices were not published in appropriate newspapers at the time of publication of the proposed listing rule. To comply with proper procedure, the Service will now provide additional time for public comment and will consider this information, and all information received previously, in its review to determine whether the white fringeless orchid needs protection under the Endangered Species Act.  

In September 2015, the Service proposed to list the white fringeless orchid as a threatened species throughout its range, which includes six Southeastern states – Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee.  A final decision on the proposal is due by September 15, 2016.

All comments will be posted on [http://www.regulations.gov](http://www.regulations.gov/).  This generally means the Service will post any personal information you provide us. If you previously submitted comments or information on the September 15, 2015 proposed rule (80 FR 55304), please do not resubmit them.  We have incorporated them into the public record.  

As part of a court-approved work plan for Multi-District Litigation with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service committed to evaluate the orchid’s status in 2015.
