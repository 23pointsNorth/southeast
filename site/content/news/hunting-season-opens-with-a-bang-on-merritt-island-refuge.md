The general waterfowl hunting season has opened big at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in Titusville, Florida.

More than a dozen vehicles started lining up more than 24 hours in advance for the opening on
Saturday, November 17. By the time the refuge opened at 4 a.m. that morning, the line of
vehicles stretched over the Max Brewer Bridge into Titusville.

So far, 960 hunters have harvested 2,411 ducks over the first two weeks of the regular
waterfowl season. Hunting resumes Saturday, December 8, and will be offered on Wednesdays,
Saturdays and Sundays during December and January, as well as Christmas Day and New Year’s
Day. A Youth Hunt will be held on February 2 and 3.

“This wildly popular opening reflects the refuge’s strong relationships with our partners like
United Waterfowlers Florida, Ducks Unlimited, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission,”
said Layne Hamilton, refuge manager. “These organizations aided the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in hosting two recent public workshops that were held to continue partnerships to
improve the refuge’s waterfowl hunt program.”

As an example of the partnerships at work, volunteers from United Waterfowlers Florida
repaired a hole in one of the refuge impoundments that was created by Hurricane Irma.
The success of the early season also reflects the work of Service employees to create
opportunities for public recreation.

The refuge allows harvesting of ducks, coots and mergansers. Common species include lessor
scaup, teal, wigeon, gadwall, and pintail.

Merritt Island NWR is located on a barrier island on Florida’s Atlantic coast along with NASA’s

Kennedy Space Center. Waterfowl hunting is permitted on 36,000 acres of the Refuge’s 140,000 acres. The remainder of the refuge is closed to hunting to protect non-game birds and endangered species and to permit other recreational activities.
