Federal and state wildlife officers are investigating the poisoning deaths of two bald eagles in Iberville parish, Louisiana, last month. A reward of up to $11,000 is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a reward of $5,000; The Humane Society of the United States and the Humane Society Wildlife Land Trust are offering $5,000; and Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries’ Operation Game Thief program is offering $1,000.

On April 9, 2015, two bald eagles, four coyotes, one opossum and three black vultures were found dead in a field in Plaquemine, Louisiana.  A pile of bait (meat and bones) with black granule spread across the top of it was also found in the field near the dead wildlife.  All of the animals and bait were taken from the field. The two eagles were found very close to each other in the field, and investigators believe poison may have been placed to target coyotes.

“Poison is an indiscriminate killer,” said Sidney Charbonnet, Special Agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “It is extremely poor practice for nuisance animal reduction, as it doesn’t just kill the target species, it can take out whole segments of the food chain with secondary poisonings, as well as potentially killing pet dogs or cats who may consume the bait or the poisoned wildlife.”

Julia Breaux, Louisiana state director for The HSUS, said: “There are humane and effective methods for resolving conflicts with coyotes that don’t involve poisoning animals, which can cause significant suffering and a slow death. We’re grateful to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries for their determination to find those responsible.”
