One of the rarest snakes in North America, the [Louisiana pinesnake](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=C02C), is found only in isolated, mostly longleaf pine forests in Louisiana and Texas.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announced today it will extend by six months the deadline for a final decision about the snake’s status under the [Endangered Species Act](/endangered-species-act), to provide more time to resolve questions about survey data and scientific uncertainty that arose during the initial comment period. At the same time, it also is reopening the comment period on the proposal for 30 days and will accept comments postmarked or date stamped on or before November 6, 2017.

In 2016, the Service proposed listing the large, non-venomous snake as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, and has been reviewing scientific data since then in order to make a final determination.

During the public comment period, the Service received comments on the proposed listing and the data used to support it. The comments reflected significant differences regarding the interpretation of the data used to determine the Louisiana pinesnake’s status and trends.

Public comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted as they are already part of the public record and will be considered in the final rule. The Service will submit a final listing determination to the _Federal Register_ on or before April 6, 2018.
