The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces it is conducting a five-year status review for the [roseate tern](http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action'spcode=B07O) throughout the entire area where it is listed.

A prior notice, issued in 2008, indicated that the Service was only conducting a status review of the roseate tern’s northeastern population. However, the Service is actually reviewing the species’ status throughout its entire range. The roseate tern is currently listed as endangered in the United States along the Atlantic Coast south to North Carolina, and includes Canada (in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Quebec) and Bermuda, as well. The roseate tern is listed as threatened in Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and adjacent oceans.

Five-year reviews are conducted to ensure that listing classifications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are accurate. Any interested party is invited to provide information and comments pertaining to these populations. Written comments and information related to these five-year reviews must be received on or before June 4, 2010.

Specifically, the review seeks information on: (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

In addition to reviewing the classification of these populations, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.
