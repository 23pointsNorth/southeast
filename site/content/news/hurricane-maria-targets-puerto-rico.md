Puerto Rico, still staggering from [Hurricane Irma](https://www.fws.gov/hurricane/irma), is now likely to get knocked down by [Hurricane Maria](https://www.fws.gov/hurricane/irma). The category 4 storm is headed its way.
 
Maria, with occasional wind gusts up to 190 mph, is expected to reach Puerto Rico’s east coast by 9 p.m. EST.
 
Expect “extensive damage,” said Kevin Scasny, a meteorologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service).

“It is not a good time” for Puerto Rico, he said in a Tuesday morning conference call with representatives of various Service divisions. The Service, as it did with Irma, is preparing to respond after the storm whips over the island.
 
San Juan, he said, is in the “bull’s eye of the eye of the storm.” It should hit Puerto Rico’s capital around 8 a.m. Wednesday and is expected to remain until about 3 p.m. Storm surges could hit 9 feet, he warned.
 
“Quite a devastating hurricane is coming,” Scasny said.
