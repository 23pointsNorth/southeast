A mature [bald eagle](https://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B008) was found shot and killed on February 24, 2016, in Polk County, Georgia.  The shooting took place near Lewis Road, north of Cedartown, Georgia.

The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are jointly investigating this incident and seek information related to the shooting.

Bald eagles are protected by the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Killing or harming a bird carries maximum penalties of up to $100,000 in fines and one year in prison.

The Service is offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to a conviction of the person or persons responsible for this unlawful act.

To provide information on this killing, contact U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Special Agent Brian Roland at (404) 763-7959, or the Georgia Department of Natural Resources’ Ranger Hotline at 1-800-241-4113.

Species information:  Bald eagles take four to five years to mature, but many do not start breeding until they are much older.  Bald eagles may live 15-25 years in the wild.  They are opportunistic feeders with fish comprising most of their diet and are found around rivers and lakes.  Bald eagles historically occurred from Mexico to Alaska. 

In Georgia, eagle nest surveys conducted in 2015 by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Nongame Conservation Section counted 210 occupied nesting territories, 166 successful nests and 270 young fledged.
