The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Panama City Field office welcomes two local teenagers, Sabrina and Star Myers, to take part in the 2017 Youth Conservation Corps (YCC), a youth employment program facilitated by the Department of Interior. Star and Sabrina are sisters who attend Rutherford High School and participate in the Air Force JROTC program. They are considering majoring in biology at Florida State University and upon graduation, becoming military officers. Instead of the typical summer high school job flipping burgers or waiting tables, Sabrina and Star will work side by side with biologists working to achieve the Service’s mission for federal trust species including gulf sturgeon, gopher tortoises and sea turtles. The YCC Program will run through mid-August.
