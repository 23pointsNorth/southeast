The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a reward of $2,500 to help find who shot a bald eagle in Boligee, Alabama. The Humane Society of the United States and the Humane Society Wildlife Land Trust are adding $5,000 to the reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.

The bald eagle was found on private property, north of the intersection of County Road 138 and U.S. Highway 11.  X-rays showed the eagle had been shot.

“The Humane Society of the United States is pleased to offer this support to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their efforts to bring to justice those who have harmed these majestic symbols of our nation in Alabama,” said Mindy Gilbert, Alabama state director for the Humane Society of the United States.
