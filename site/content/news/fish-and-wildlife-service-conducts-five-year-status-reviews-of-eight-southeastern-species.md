As part of the process mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct [five-year status reviews](/endangered-species-act/five-year-reviews) of eight endangered fish, wildlife, and plants.  These species are found in the Southeastern United States and Puerto Rico.

The public is invited to provide information and comments concerning these species on or before May 11, 2018.

These five-year reviews will ensure listing classifications under the ESA are accurate and recommend changes in status where appropriate based on the latest science and analysis.  In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species' recovery progress.  It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. 

Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.

This notice announces our active review of eight species listed here that are currently federally listed as endangered:

## Amphibians

  - Coqui llanero;

## Clams

  - Carolina heelsplitter;

## Crustaceans

  - Hell Creek cave crayfish;

## Plants

  - Aristida chaseae;
  - Pelos del diablo;
  - Smooth coneflower;
  - Cooley's meadowrue;
  - Louisiana quillwort

The five-year reviews seek information on:
  
  1. species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics;
  2. habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability;
  3. conservation measures that have been implemented;
  4. threat status and trends; and
  5. other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods.  

Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

The Federal Register notice announcing the status review of these eight federally listed fish, wildlife and plants [is available online](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/current) on March 12, 2018.
 
Written comments and information about them should be e-mailed, faxed, or sent via regular mail to:
