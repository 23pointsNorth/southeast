As part of the process mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct [five-year status reviews](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/endangered-species-act/five-year-reviews) of 22 endangered fish, wildlife, and plants, and one threatened species, the Ozark cavefish.  These species are found in the Southeastern United States and [Puerto Rico](/puerto-rico).

The public is invited to provide information and comments concerning these species on or before August 29, 2017.

These five-year reviews will ensure listing classifications under the [ESA](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/endangered-species-act) are accurate and recommend changes in status where appropriate based on the latest science and analysis.  In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress.  It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. 

Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.

This notice announces our active review of the Ozark cavefish that is currently federally listed as threatened, and the other 22 species listed here that are currently federally listed as endangered:

## Mammals

 - [Florida panther](/wildlife/mammals/florida-panther);

## Birds

 - Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk
 - Puerto Rican nightjar

## Fishes

  - [Cumberland darter](/wildlife/fishes/cumberland-darter/)
  - Rush darter
  - Vermilion darter
  - Pygmy madtom

## Clams

  - [Cumberland bean](/wildlife/mussels/cumberland-bean/)
  - [Ring pink](/wildlife/mussels/ring-pink/)

## Snails

  - Anthony’s riversnail

## Plants

  - Braun’s rock-cress
  - Deltoid spurge
  - Morefield’s leatherflower
  - Cumberland rosemary
  - Small’s milkpe
  - Lyonia truncata var. proctorii (no common name)
  - Tiny polygala
  - Ruth’s golden aster
  - Alabama canebrake pitcher plant
  - [American chaffseed](/wildlife/plants/american-chaffseed/)
  - Vernonia proctorii (no common name)
  - Adiantum vivesii (no common name)

The five-year reviews seek information on: (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and, (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods.  Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

The *Federal Register* notice announcing the status review of these 23 federally listed fish, wildlife and plants is available online at [federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/).  Please refer to FWS–R4–ES–2017–N024, which is the docket number for this action.
