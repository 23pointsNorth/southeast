The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) will initiate a joint enforcement effort over the weekend of May 22<sup>nd</sup> to enforce the federal and state Manatee zones in Brevard County.  The joint enforcement effort will run from Friday, May 22<sup>nd</sup> through Monday, May 25th.

Along with USFWS and FWC agents and officers, numerous federal, state and local marine enforcement units from the area will be participating in the enforcement detail to enforce not only the manatee protection zones but other legal requirements on the water, as well.

The federal manatee protection zones and regulations may be found online at: [http://www.fws.gov/northflorida/Manatee/Documents/MPARules/index-federal-mpa-maps.htm](http://www.fws.gov/northflorida/Manatee/Documents/MPARules/index-federal-mpa-maps.htm). 

Those areas designated as protected pursuant to the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act may be at: [http://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/managed/manatee/data-and-maps/](http://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/managed/manatee/data-and-maps/)

In those areas where the federal and state zones are not identical, the more restrictive zone takes precedence. The web page maps provide a general overview of the areas that have manatee speed zones but are not a substitute for on-the-water markings. When in doubt, follow the rules as posted on the signs and delineated by the buoys throughout the designated areas in Brevard County to mark the regulated zones. 

Manatee zone boundaries are marked by large posted signs and buoys; both are white in color with international orange lettering. 

Federal and State regulations require vessel operators to operate at the appropriate posted speeds within the manatee zones. Portions of the manatee zones are regulated at a maximum speed of 25 mph and are enforced utilizing RADAR units.

According to the regulations, a watercraft is considered to be proceeding at slow speed minimum wake when this three part definition is met; bow down, vessel is fully settled in the water, and creating a minimum wake.

However, if a vessel is on plane, in the process of coming up on or coming off of plane, or creating an excessive wake it is **not** considered to be proceeding at slow speed.  There is no mile per hour speed attached to slow and idle zones. Slow speed and idle speed are based upon the attitude of the vessel.  Idle Speed is considered to be enough forward momentum to maintain steerage of a vessel.

Law enforcement participants in this joint effort will be doing strict enforcement of the manatee zones. Federal fines range from $125 to $25,000 and/or six (6) months imprisonment under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The fines increase for each subsequent violation of any state or federal manatee zone throughout the state.

Voluntary compliance is a win-win for boaters and for Florida manatees: providing for safe passage for both through Florida’s waterways.
