As part of the process mandated by the [Endangered Species Act](/endangered-species-act/) (ESA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct [five-year status](/endangered-species-act/five-year-reviews) reviews of 35 endangered or threatened fish, wildlife, and plants. These species are found in the Southeastern United States and Puerto Rico.

The public is invited to provide information and comments concerning these species on or before July 6, 2018.

These five-year reviews will ensure listing classifications under the ESA are accurate and recommend changes in status where appropriate based on the latest science and analysis. In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts.

Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.
