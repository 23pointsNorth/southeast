Damage assessment continues in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Irma. All U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees are safe, but about 70 percent of the island was without power Friday morning, and ATMs were not working.

Culebra National Wildlife Refuge reported minor damage to its greenhouse and shop office.

Service meteorologist Kevin Scasny estimates Irma will make landfall in south Florida, around 6 a.m. Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane. It will continue up the Florida peninsula, possibly inflicting damage on both coasts simultaneously due to its size. Rainfall in Florida is expected to be 6-10 inches. Irma is predicted to move into Georgia early next week, probably downgrading to a tropical storm as it spends more time inland.

[An estimated 2.6 million homes](http://ioe-guikema.engin.umich.edu/Hurricane_Irma.html) in the Southeast, mainly in Florida and Georgia, will probably lose power due to the storm.

57 Service stations and refuges are in Irmaâ€™s path as of Friday morning.
