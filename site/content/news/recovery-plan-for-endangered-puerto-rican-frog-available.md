“Kee, kee,” a male [coquí llanero](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=D03V) softly sings from dusk to dawn in a Puerto Rican wetland.  Hearing its high-pitched call is rare because the tiny frog is only found in one freshwater wetland in the municipality of Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has prepared a [final recovery plan](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/Recovery%20Plan%20for%20the%20Coqui%20llanero.pdf) outlining actions to save this dime-sized frog, which has been federally listed as endangered since October 2012.

The recovery plan for the coquí llanero describes actions considered necessary for its recovery, establishes criteria for reclassification to delisting, and estimates the time and cost for implementing needed measures.

According to the recovery plan, the coquí llanero can be considered for delisting when:

1. three viable coquí llanero populations demonstrate stable or increasing population trends;
2. habitat areas for three viable coquí llanero populations are protected through land acquisition or conservation easements; and,
3. threats and causes of decline have been reduced or eliminated to a degree that the coquí llanero does not need protection under the Endangered Species Act.

Some of the recovery actions needed to accomplish these goals are monitoring, managing, and protecting the one known wild population at Toa Baja through land acquisitions, or conservation easements, and by developing management plans; finding other wetlands suitable for coquí llanero introductions or reintroductions; and educating the public about the coquí llanero and its habitat requirements.
