The Fish and Wildlife Service, [Panama City Field Office](https://www.fws.gov/panamacity) congratulates Rutherford High School students Sabrina and Starr Myers for a productive and successful summer as a member of the [Youth Conservation Corps (YCC)](/work-with-us/internships#for-high-school-students).  This federally funded youth employment program facilitated by the Department of Interior, gives local high school student and opportunity for hands on experience working with endangered species and scientific research through civic engagement.  Starr and Sabrina worked with biologist specializing in Gulf sturgeon, beach mice, sea turtles, Flatwood salamander and freshwater mussels.  In addition to field work, they produced educational videos and created endangered plants posters.  They also assisted in a fishing clinic hosted by the Childrenâ€™s Home Society of Florida.

On their final day, they gave an in-depth presentation of a plant and animal species they selected to research.   Their upbeat and positive attitude gave a welcomed jolt of energy and vitality to our team members.   We thank them for them serving our community as a Fish and Wildlife Service YCC member.
