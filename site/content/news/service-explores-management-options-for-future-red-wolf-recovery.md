This week, the Service kicked-off an environmental review of the only wild population of the red wolf in the world. Two scoping meetings were held within the Non-essential Experimental Population area to give community members a chance to ask questions and learn more about red wolf recovery. About 90 people attended one or both meetings held on June 6, 2017, 6:30-8:30 p.m., at Mattamuskeet High School in Swan Quarter, NC; and June 8, 2017, 6:30-8:30 p.m., at [Coastal North Carolina National Wildlife Refuges Visitor Center](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Alligator_River/visit/visitor_center.html) in Manteo, NC. Attendees discussed red wolf recovery issues with our staff, some provided written and oral comments. Others were still researching, collecting information and expressed interest in sharing their thoughts and ideas online at [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-R4-ES-2017-0006-0001). The comment period runs through July 24, 2017. [Check out photos of the meetings on Flickr](http://bit.ly/2t2wtZu).
