The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has posted a reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for shooting a bald eagle during the last week of March (possibly on the 25tt -27th) in Pearlington, Mississippi, about 40 miles northeast of New Orleans.

The shooting may have occurred while the eagle was perched in a tree. Passersby found the wounded eagle and took it to the Pet Haven Veterinary Hospital for surgery. If the eagle recovers, it will be released back into the wild.

Shooting an eagle is a violation of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act allows for a reward of up to $2,500 for information that leads to a conviction.

Any information on this incident should be provided to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Special Agent Ben Bryant at (985) 882-3756, or the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks at 1-800-Be-Smart.

The mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.
