The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today urged waterfowl hunters to use caution on the eve of
Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge’s early waterfowl season pointing to damage and access
challenges in Hurricane Irma’s wake.

The early waterfowl season is set to run from September 16 through September 24. The early
teal season will be open as planned this year.

Reaching some areas will be challenging. Hunters should expect high water levels, storm
damage and submerged debris.  Access points will be limited and hunters should plan ahead.
Currently, the Bio-Lab Boat Ramp and the south end of Bio-Lab Road will be available with full
access to Mosquito Lagoon Hunt Areas 2 and 3. Access to the Shiloh impoundments on the
Indian River side is open, but hunters should be wary of obstacles created by fallen trees. Efforts
are underway to provide additional access to Hunt Area 1, including L&amp;M-Pond impoundments
as soon as possible. Peacocks Pocket and Catfish Creek levees adjacent to the Indian River
suffered severe damage from Irma and will not be available for early teal season. Repairs to
these areas are expected to be completed and partial access restored before the general waterfowl
season opens in November.

At the same time, the Refuge announced it will use last year’s rules for waterfowl hunting. This
action reverses a decision earlier this year that would have reduced the 2017-2018 waterfowl
hunting season both in terms of number of permits and number of days on a 7,000-acre section of
the Refuge.

“We realized too late that we didn’t follow through with our plans to communicate with
stakeholders, and our state partners before this year’s season,” said Layne Hamilton, the project
leader for Merritt Island NWR. “We are going to do a better job communicating about future
management needs with user groups and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
before adopting changes in the future.”

A new hunting brochure with information and requirements for the upcoming waterfowl season
will be available on Merritt Island’s web site within two weeks. Updates regarding access to
hunt areas and boat ramps will be posted on the [Refuge’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MerrittIslandNWR/) and [its website](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Merritt_Island/).

Established in 1963, the refuge covers roughly 140,000 acres and is managed by the Service.
NASA owns most of the land that makes up the refuge. It was established to provide a buffer for
America’s space program activities at the John F. Kennedy Space Center.
