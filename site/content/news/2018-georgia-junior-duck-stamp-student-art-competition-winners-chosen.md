For the third year in a row, Rayen Kang, an 18-year-old student at the First Fine Art & Design Studio in Johns Creek has been announced as the winner of the annual 2018 Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Art Competition held Tuesday, April 10, at the Southeast Region U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office (Service) in Atlanta.

Five judges selected Kang’s acrylic rendition of an emperor goose as the Georgia Best of Show.  She will receive a $175 scholarship from Georgia Power, a long-time sponsor of the Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Program, as well as a certificate and ribbon. As Georgia’s Best of Show, Kang’s original artwork will be sent to compete in the National Junior Duck Stamp Contest being held on Friday April 20 in Bismark, North Dakota.

“I have been drawing ducks for the past several years, and I chose the emperor goose to see if there was a difference in painting a goose or a swan”, said Ms. Kang when notified she won this year’s contest. She spent about 30 hours on this painting including experimenting with different ways to paint the water.

This year, 477 Junior Duck Stamp entries of 46 different species were submitted statewide from 14 different public and private schools, home schools, and art studios.  Kang’s winning entry was submitted through art teacher Zhi Qu, at First Fine Art & Design Studio in Johns Creek, which submitted 25 various placed winning artwork entries.

A panel of distinguished judges selected for their expertise in artistic design, wildlife art, and waterfowl biology decided the winners of this year’s Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Contest. A total of 100 winners were selected, featuring 25 winners in each of four different age groups:  Kindergarten to third grade, fourth to sixth grade, seventh to ninth grade and tenth to twelfth grade, as well as the state’s Best of Show. Three first place, three second place, three third place and 16 honorable mention winners were chosen in each of the four categories. The Best of Show was selected from among all of the first place winners.

This year’s panel of esteemed judges included:  Kevin Lowery, wildlife biologist, Georgia Department of Natural Resources; Jim Ozier, wildlife biologist, Georgia Power, long-time sponsors of the Georgia Junior Duck Contest; Ernie Clark, Service deputy regional supervisor Area 2 Refuges, Brett Wehrle, Service project leader of the Central Louisiana National Wildlife Refuge Complex and Dean Demarest, deputy chief, Migratory Bird Program, Service, Southeast Region.

Prizes and ribbons are also being given for the best student conservation message that expresses the spirit of what they learned while researching and planning for their Duck Stamp Contest artwork entry. This year’s winning conservation message was submitted by 12 year old Hannah Jiang from First Fine Art & Design Studio in Johns Creek:

> “The past and the present teach us how to conserve in the future.”
