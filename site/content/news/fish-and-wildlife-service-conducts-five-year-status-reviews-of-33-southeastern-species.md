The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct five-year status reviews of 25 endangered and eight threatened species occurring in one or more of the 10 states in the Southeast and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The public is invited to provide written information and comments concerning these species on or before May 27, 2014.

These five-year reviews will ensure listing classifications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are accurate. In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.

This notice announces a review of 25 species currently listed as endangered: Anastasia Island beach mouse, Perdido Key beach mouse, southeastern beach mouse, Puerto Rican parrot, Cumberland elktoe, Appalachian elktoe, yellow blossom, southern combshell, green blossom, tubercled blossom, speckled pocketbook, black clubshell, flat pigtoe, heavy pigtoe, stirrupshell, Alabama cave shrimp, plicate rocksnail, flat pebblesnail, cylindrical lioplax, golden sedge, Etonia rosemary, Rugel’s pawpaw, longspurred mint, Canby’s dropwort, and Shorts goldenrod.

This notice also announces the Service’s review of eight species currently listed as threatened: painted snake coiled forest snail, lacy elimia, round rocksnail, painted rocksnail, Florida bonamia, scrub buckwheat, telephus spurge, and Miccosukee gooseberry.

Specifically, this review seeks information on: (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and, (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

The Federal Register notice announcing the status review of these 33 federally listed species is available [online](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/03/25/2014-06502/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-5-year-status-reviews-of-33-southeastern-species).
