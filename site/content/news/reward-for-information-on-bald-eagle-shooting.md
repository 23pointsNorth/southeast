**SHREVEPORT, LA** - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries are seeking information on the shooting of a bald eagle that was found near Cavett River Road in Gilliam, Louisiana.   

The Humane Society of the United States, The Humane Society Wildlife Land Trust, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are offering a reward of up to $7,500 for information leading to a conviction of the person or persons responsible for this unlawful act.

On March 22, 2015, an incapacitated, mature, American bald eagle was recovered in Caddo Parish near Cavett River Road.  The bald eagle displayed wounds to its chest and left wing. The eagle was transported to the Louisiana State University Veterinary Hospital for treatment.  X-rays confirmed that the injuries were due to gunshot.  The eagle was euthanized as a result of the severity of its injuries.

Bald eagles are protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Violations of these statutes carry maximum criminal penalties of up to $100,000 and $15,000 respectively and/or up to one year in federal prison.
