The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Florida Keys National Wildlife Refuges Complex and their Friends group FAVOR announce their first annual Outdoor Fest -- four action-packed days filled with family-friendly -- mostly free outdoor adventures and hands-on activities -- set for Thursday, March 17th through Sunday, March 20th.  

The event location spans the four national wildlife refuges established in the Florida Keys National Key Deer, Crocodile Lake, Great White Heron, and Key West National Wildlife Refuges and features expert guided birding and nature walks, art and photography workshops, kids programs, kayak excursions, a natural history bike ride, and the 2nd Annual Run With Deer 5K on Big Pine Key.

The Outdoor Fest was created to encourage people to get outside in a wildlife-friendly manner while promoting an understanding and appreciation of the refuges—home to some of the world’s most endangered habitats, plants, and wildlife species.  Eco-tourists, nature-lovers, birding enthusiasts, nature photographers, artists, runners, and outdoor adventure-inclined families will find much to explore in the four day outdoor extravaganza.

The Outdoor Fest is brought to you in part by the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.  For more information about the refuges, FAVOR, and the list of events, visit www.favorfloridakeys.org/outdoor-fest.
