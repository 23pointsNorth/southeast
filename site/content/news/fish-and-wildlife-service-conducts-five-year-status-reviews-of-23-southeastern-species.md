The Service [plans to conduct five-year status reviews](http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/E9-15918.html) of 15 endangered and 8 threatened species occurring in one or more of 10 states.

These five-year reviews are conducted to ensure that listing classifications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are accurate. Any interested party is invited to provide information and comments pertaining to these species. Written comments and information related to these five-year reviews must be received on or before September 4, 2009.

This notice covers the following species federally listed as endangered:

### Amphibians

- Mississippi gopher frog

### Fish

- Alabama sturgeon
- Cape Fear shiner
- Cahaba shiner
- bluemask darter
- amber darter
- Etowah darter

### Mussels

- Tar River spinymussel

###  Snails

- Anthonys riversnail

### Insects

- Saint Francis satyr butterfly

### Plants

- mountain sweet pitcher plant
- bunched arrowhead
- white irisette
- Tennessee yellow-eyed grass
- Spring Creek bladderpod

This notice also covers the following species federally listed as threatened: flattened musk turtle (reptile); spotfin chub (fish); Waccamaw silverside (fish); Cherokee darter (fish); Magazine Mountain shagreen (snail); Hellers blazing star (plant); Prices potato-bean (plant); and Cumberland rosemary (plant).

Specifically, this review seeks information on: (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.
