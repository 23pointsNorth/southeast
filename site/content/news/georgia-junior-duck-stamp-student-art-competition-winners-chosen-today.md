Colin Williams, a 15-year-old artist from Savannah, Georgia, has been announced as the winner of the 2010 statewide Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest held today, in Atlanta, Georgia. Five judges unanimously selected Williams’ acrylic paint rendition of a blue-winged teal out of 701 entries as the Georgia Best of Show.

Williams will receive a $250 scholarship from Georgia Power and more than $100 worth of art supplies and conservation education field guides. As Georgia’s Best of Show, William’s artwork has also been sent for the federal competition scheduled on Friday, April 23, at the Science Museum of Minnesota.

“Wow!” Williams exclaimed when Regional Director Cindy Dohner told him he won the “Best of Show” award for the State of Georgia.

“I researched and reviewed photos for two weeks,” he said. “It took five hours a day for about two weeks to paint it, and I got a late start.”

“I chose this duck because it flies through Georgia on the way to Mexico,” he said. “I’ve made five paintings with acrylics, but this is my first duck.”

It was also his first entry into the Junior Duck Stamp Contest.

This year, Junior Duck Stamp entries were submitted from 48 public and private schools, home schools, art studios, and after-school programs throughout the state. William’s winning entry was submitted through teacher Steve Schetski of Savannah Arts Academy in Savannah, Georgia.

A panel of distinguished judges selected for their expertise in artistic design, wildlife art, and waterfowl biology decided the winners of this year’s Georgia Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest. A total of 100 winners were selected, featuring twenty-five winners in each of four different age groups: Kindergarten to third grade, fourth to sixth grade, seventh to ninth grade and tenth to twelfth grade, as well as the state’s Best of Show.
