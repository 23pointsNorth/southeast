A dozen more U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staffers have landed in Puerto Rico to help with Hurricane Maria recovery, joining teams already on the island. But they face daunting challenges.

The U.S. territory still has almost no electricity, and fresh drinking water is a big problem for many, Service employees in Puerto Rico said Wednesday on a conference call. Fuel is extremely hard to get, which makes operations more difficult.

Service task forces are coordinating with other federal agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, to help the people of Puerto Rico back on their feet. Service teams are delivering supplies and food to people in need.

The good news is that 60 out of 61 Service employees in the Caribbean region have now been accounted for and are safe, and efforts are underway to locate the one remaining employee.

The weather, however, is getting worse. Service meteorologist Kevin Scasny said that rain is moving in soon. About 1-3 inches can be expected over the next five days. Temperatures will continue to get to near 100 degrees.
