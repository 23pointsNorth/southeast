Orangeburg, South Carolina — County Hatchery Pond may soon be open to anglers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced.

The pond would be open for all legal species. It’s located in the Orangeburg National Fish Hatchery substation on Cannon Bridge Road in Cordova, about six miles southwest of Orangeburg.

The area would be open for anglers from dawn until dusk. All state of South Carolina fishing regulations will apply.

An opening date has not been set, but the areas should be open by late summer. The public is encouraged to comment, preferably in writing. The draft [Fishing Plan](/pdf/plan/orangeburg-nfh-draft-fishing-plan.pdf) and [Environmental Assessment](/pdf/environmental-assessment/orangeburg-nfh-draft-environmental-assessment-fishing-plan.pdf) can be found in the hatchery office and online at [fws.gov/orangeburg/](https://www.fws.gov/orangeburg/).
