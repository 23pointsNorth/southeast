The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announced today the completion and availability of the five-year status review of the [red wolf](/wildlife/mammal/red-wolf).
  
After reviewing all of the best scientific and commercially available information and data, the Service recommended that the current listing classification for the red wolf remain unchanged. This means the world's only wild red wolf population, restored in North Carolina, continues to have non-essential, experimental status. Red wolves located at island propagation sites and in captive breeding facilities continue to have full endangered status.

"Experimental status has meant success in red wolf restoration and in flexibility for landowners," said Bud Fazio, team leader of the Service's Red Wolf Recovery Program. "We thank all our partners for helping to make red wolf restoration successful.  We particularly thank the landowners who work regularly with us to conserve red wolves in a balance that also conserves
their own rural heritage and lifestyle."

Service biologists acknowledge that the wild red wolf population restored to North Carolina faces some challenges. Solutions are being sought to reduce levels of mortality caused by vehicle strikes and by gunshots. The good stewardship of hunters, landowners, and local communities can make a big difference in developing such solutions.

"The Service's five-year review also contains other recommendations for future actions aimed at continuing progress toward long-term recovery of red wolves.
