**JAMESTOWN, KY** – Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery is the place to be in March with a multitude of environmental education activities to participate in. Most of the events are located at the Wolf Creek NFH Visitor Center.

Thursday, March 3rd, 4:30 – 6 pm CST – Join us in the Environmental Education Classroom for a Shiitake Mushroom Log workshop.  The cost of this event is $10/log, checks can be made payable to Friends of Wolf Creek NFH, Inc. Preregistration is required by March 1st.  From this workshop you will take home your own Shiitake Mushroom Log.  Log-grown shiitakes are more nutritious than commercial shiitakes grown on sawdust blocks.  Shiitakes are low in fat, high in protein, vitamins, and minerals.  The workshop will also include recipes for delicious meals and maybe some sampling.  

Tuesday, March 8th, 1 – 2 pm CST – Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery will hold their monthly meeting at the Visitor Center. The primary purpose of the Friends is to support the mission and programs of the Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery and to advocate for its continued operation. This support can be in the form of financial assistance, operational assistance, to educate the public and/or lobby political leaders.  The friends group also plays a vital role in planning, promoting, and conducting fishing events; they promote the proper use and preservation of Kentucky streams, rivers, and lakes and provide environmental education programs to the public.  If you are looking to be a part of a progressive community organization and believe in this mission, or just wanting more information, please visit www.friendsofwolfcreeknfh.com, or call 270-343-3797 or email friendsofwolfcreeknfh@gmail.com.  

Tuesday, March 15th, 5 – 6:30 pm CST – Nature Rocks! Family Nature Club – We will meet at the Russell County Public Library branch location in Russell Springs to explore the “Dirt on Soil”.  A hands on Environmental Education program will be presented by Jason Miller Natural Resource Planner, USDA/NRCS, Columbia Service Center.  Crafts and snacks will also be included.

March 15th is also the deadline to enter the 2016 Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest!  It’s not too late to enter.  For more information call Wolf Creek or visit http://www.fws.gov/juniorduck/.

Saturday, March 19th noon – 2 pm CST – Celebrate Earth Hour & Squirt the Skunks 8th Birthday! Help Shine a Light on Climate Action in 2016!  Join us as we turn off the lights and explore alternative energy sources!  Enjoy an open fire cooking demonstration and create a nature craft for Squirt.  Stop by the open fire cooking display and discover a dozen ways to cook outdoors! Take home tasty ideas for camping, hiking, or just fun in the back yard. Recipes and instructions will be available. Watch as we bake a cake in the Dutch oven to celebrate Squirt’s birthday!
