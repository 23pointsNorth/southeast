Georgia aster is an uncommon Southern plant that declined for decades, to the verge of receiving federal protection. However, nine organizations, private and public, are committing to conserve the plant in an effort that should keep it off the endangered species list.  The commitment will be memorialized this Friday in an agreement called a Candidate Conservation Agreement, designed to proactively conserve plants and animals before they need Federal protection.

The plant is found in five counties in north and central Alabama, 15 counties in north and central Georgia, 14 counties in the Piedmont area of South Carolina, and nine counties in central North Carolina.
