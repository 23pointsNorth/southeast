Found only in a small portion of the Cumberland Plateau in northern Tennessee and southern Kentucky, the Cumberland sandwort was headed toward extinction before it was listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1988. That’s when the states of Tennessee and Kentucky, federal agencies and conservation groups stepped in to protect and restore this unique plant.

Thanks to these ESA-inspired partnerships, Cumberland sandwort populations are now healthy, robust and stable, and a scientifically rigorous review of the best available science has determined the species  no longer faces the threat of extinction. Now, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to delist the sandwort under the ESA and is making available a draft post-delisting monitoring plan (PDM) to help ensure it remains healthy and secure after it is delisted.

The proposal follows more than 30 years of conservation partnerships between the Service and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Kentucky Nature Preserves, National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service

“Partnerships are the key to the success of the Endangered Species Act,” said Leo Miranda, the Service’s Regional Director. “The National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service and states of Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as the Missouri Botanical Garden, all played important roles in bringing back and sustaining this delicate flower. Future generations will be grateful that it is around for them to enjoy.”

Land protection and habitat management have been vital to protecting and recovering the sandwort. This plant was originally listed due to overuse or destruction of habitat from recreational activities. To address these threats, partners installed signs, fencing and boardwalks that educate visitors about public lands and protect the plant.

The sandwort is found in 66 places on federal and state conservation lands that are individually managed by the National Park Service, Tennessee Division of Forestry, Tennessee Division of Natural Areas, or Tennessee State Parks. Pickett State Forest, owned by the Tennessee Division of Forestry, has 29 occurrences alone.

Other conservation partners include the Missouri Botanical Garden, which collected Cumberland sandwort seeds over many years to maintain seed viability in storage. Tennessee, Kentucky and the National Park Service have monitored the species status in known locations and conducted surveys to record previously unknown occurrences.

While the Service recommended downlisting the sandwort from endangered to threatened in this document, new information indicated threats had been further reduced and new populations discovered, supporting this proposed delisting.

The Service also is announcing the availability of a draft post-delisting monitoring (PDM) plan for the sandwort, which will to help ensure the sandwort remains healthy and secure from the risk of extinction after it is delisted. We seek information, data and comments from the public regarding this proposal to delist this species and on the draft PDM plan.
