Jeff Weller is the Fish and Wildlife Service’s new field supervisor for its [Louisiana Ecological Services office](http://www.fws.gov/lafayette/) in Lafayette, Louisiana.  He began his duties February 13.

The Louisiana Ecological Services office is involved in a number of important conservation issues including protecting and restoring ecosystems, habitats, and populations, with emphasis on wetlands and other declining habitats that support threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, and fisheries.

As field supervisor, Jeff will represent the U. S. Department of the Interior on the Coastal Wetland Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) Task Force working closely with partners on restoration efforts along Louisiana’s coast.

"We are happy to have Jeff as the new project leader in Lafayette,” says Leopoldo Miranda-Castro, Assistant Regional Director for Ecological Services.  “His commitment to conserving and managing natural resources, combined with his leadership skills, will complement all the great work being done by office staff, state agencies and the conservation community in Louisiana."

For the last three years, Jeff served as the ecological service’s program supervisor providing supervision, guidance and support to 14 ecological services offices in the Southeast Region.  Prior to that, he was the Southeast Region’s chief of planning and permitting in the ecological services program.  He also worked in the Vero Beach, Florida Ecological Services Field office on transportation issues.  Before joining the Service in 2000, he worked for the Florida Department of Transportation and the Broward County Parks and Recreation Department.

“I’m honored to be here and appreciate the hospitality shown by the Lafayette staff and the community,” says Weller.  “I look forward to working collaboratively with our many partners and carrying on the excellent work of my predecessors in promoting habitat and species restoration throughout Louisiana.”   Jeff earned his bachelor's degree in terrestrial biology from the University of Charleston in West Virginia and his master’s degree in marine biology from Nova University in south Florida.  A native of Millbrook, New York, Jeff’s hobbies include fishing, golfing and discussing college football.
