The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability of a draft Environmental Impact Statement evaluating a proposed multi-species, multi-state draft Habitat Conservation Plan and application for an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act. The HCP was developed by NiSource Inc., a natural gas distribution company, as it seeks an incidental take permit for operating and maintaining its network of pipelines in 14 northeastern, Midwest and southeastern states.

The Endangered Species Act requires an approved Habitat Conservation Plan before an incidental take permit is granted. HCPs are agreements between a landowner and the Service, allowing landowners to undertake otherwise lawful activities on their property that may result in the incidental death, injury or harassment of a listed species; the landowner agrees to conservation measures designed to minimize and mitigate the impact of those actions.

In its draft EIS, the Service evaluated the possible environmental impacts of implementing NiSource’s Habitat Conservation Plan and the potential effects of granting an incidental take permit under the Endangered Species Act.  Among the alternatives evaluated by the Service are issuing a permit for 50 years, as requested by NiSource; a “no-action” alternative, under which NiSource would continue to work with the Service on a case-by-case basis for all its activities; and issuing a permit for 10 years.

NiSource’s draft HCP covers the company’s activities that may result in take of endangered or threatened species along its pipeline network. The plan addresses conservation needs for 10 federally endangered, threatened or proposed species for which take might occur, along with measures to avoid take of an additional 33 federally endangered, threatened or candidate species.  NiSource’s draft HCP includes measures to avoid or reduce impacts on those species resulting from business activities, as well as mitigation practices such as protecting existing habitat, creating new habitat for protected species, and identifying research to better understand endangered species.

The Service is accepting comments on the draft EIS through October 11, 2011.  Send written comments via U.S. mail to the
