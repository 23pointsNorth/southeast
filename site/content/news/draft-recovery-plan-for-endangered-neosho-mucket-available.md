The Neosho mucket is a freshwater mussel that grows up to five inches long, which is large for a mussel, and is found in river basins in Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri.

It was listed as an endangered species in 2013 under the Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has been working closely with private landowners and communities, state and federal agencies, universities, and conservation institutes, to survey for individuals and protect and restore the mussel’s habitat.

The Service now has a [draft recovery plan for the Neosho mucket](/pdf/recovery-plan/neosho-mucket-2018.pdf) available for public comment.

The mussel is threatened by the destruction or modification of its habitat or range, small population sizes, and vulnerability to natural or human induced catastrophic events.

The draft plan describes actions considered necessary for the recovery of this listed mussel, establishes recovery criteria for delisting, and estimates the time and cost for implementing needed measures.  

Request a paper copy of the plan and its associated documents by contacting the Service’s Arkansas Ecological Services Field Office at 501-513-4470.
  
Public comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or before October 16, 2018.
