The recovery plan for the for the Pyne’s ground-plum, a federally listed, endangered plant, is now available.  The plan describes actions considered necessary for the plant’s recovery, establishes criteria for downlisting and delisting the species, and estimates the time and cost for implementing the needed measures. 

Found in middle Tennessee, this rare plant exists on the edges of limestone cedar clearings and in the open areas of surrounding cedar woodlands in full to moderate light.  A member of the pea family, the Pyne’s ground-plum is a perennial, a plant which survives for more than two growing seasons.

There are eight known locations where the plant is found; all are within a short distance of the rapidly growing city of Murfreesboro.  Five of the occurrences are located on public lands and are protected.  However, the three remaining places where the plant is found are located on private lands where development pressures are increasing at a rapid rate.

According to the recovery plan, Pyne’s ground-plum will be considered for delisting when there are 12 populations distributed throughout the cedar glades of the Stones River Basin of Davidson, Rutherford, and Wilson counties. Each population should have at least 100 plants, be maintained for at least 10 years, have a cooperative management agreement in place, and be located on lands owned and managed by a public agency or located on private lands protected by a permanent conservation easement.   

All of the known Pyne’s ground-plum occurrences are threatened by the encroachment of more competitive vegetation and/or trees, such as the eastern red cedar, that produce shade and compete for limited water and nutrients.  Active management to reduce or eliminate this encroachment is required to ensure that the species continues to survive at all the sites.

For a copy of the recovery plan, please contact the Tennessee Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 446 Neal Street, Cookeville, Tennessee, 38501, or telephone 931-528-6481, ext. 211.
