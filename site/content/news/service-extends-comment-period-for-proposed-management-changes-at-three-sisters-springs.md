In response to requests received from the local community and elected officials, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is extending the comment period by more than three weeks on a draft proposal for the future management of Three Sisters Springs at Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge through Friday, December 18, 2015\.  

“In conversations with tour operators, the Citrus County Chamber of Commerce, and congressional representatives, we believe extending the comment period on our revised proposal is needed,” said James Burnett, project leader for the Northwest Florida National Wildlife Refuge Complex.  

The Service seeks public review of this draft Environmental Assessment, which also can be found at [http://www.fws.gov/crystalriver](http://www.fws.gov/crystalriver).  More information about this can be found at [http://www.fws.gov/southeast](http://www.fws.gov/southeast).  Comments must be submitted by December 18, 2015\.  Comments may be e-mailed to: [crystalriver@fws.gov](mailto:crystalriver@fws.gov?subject=Three%20Sisters%20Springs%20Draft%20Environmental%20Assessment).
