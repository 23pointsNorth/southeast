As part of the process mandated by the [Endangered Species Act](/endangered-species-act) (ESA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries will jointly conduct a [five-year status review](/endangered-species-act/five-year-reviews) of the Atlantic sturgeon (Gulf subspecies).  This fish, federally listed as threatened, is found along the coasts and in the rivers of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

The public is invited to provide information and comments concerning the Atlantic sturgeon on or before June 10, 2019.

The Atlantic sturgeon was once found from Canada to Florida. The Gulf subspecies is currently found in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi.

This five-year review will ensure listing classifications under the ESA are accurate and recommend changes in status if appropriate based on the latest scientific information.  In addition to reviewing the classification of this species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track its recovery progress.  It may benefit this fish by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. 

Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.

For this five-year review, the Service seeks information on: 

1. the Atlantic sturgeon’s  biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics;
2. habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability;
3. conservation measures that have been implemented;
4. threat status and trends; and,
5. other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods.  Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.
