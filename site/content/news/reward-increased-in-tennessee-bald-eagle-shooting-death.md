The Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society Wildlife Land  Trust are adding a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the shooting of a bald eagle found in Hamilton County, Tennessee. This reward comes following a $2,500 reward offered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which continues to investigate the case with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. Previous reward offerings have been unsuccessful in generating any leads. 

## The Case

On March 9, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency officers discovered a bald eagle in the Lost Lake Subdivision area of Hamilton County. Investigators believe the eagle was shot sometime between March 1 and March 9.

Bald eagles are protected by the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Penalties for violation of these laws include civil penalties, criminal penalties and/or prison.

“This senseless shooting and the blatant disregard for the survival of our national icon is appalling,” said Eric Swafford, Tennessee state director for The Humane Society of the United States. “We are grateful to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency for their diligent efforts to bring the offender to justice.” 

## The Investigators

Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Special Agent at 615-736- 5532, ext. 103, or the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency at 931-787- 0859.

## Resources

The HSUS and the Trust work with state and federal wildlife agencies to offer rewards of $5,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of suspected poachers. Other services include assistance with internet wildlife trafficking investigations, donation of robotic decoys and forensic equipment, funds to support wildlife K-9 programs, outreach to prosecutors to encourage vigorous prosecution of poachers and legislative work to strengthen penalties for poaching.
