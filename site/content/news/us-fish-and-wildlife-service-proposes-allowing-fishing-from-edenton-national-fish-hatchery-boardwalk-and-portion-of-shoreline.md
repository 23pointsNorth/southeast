**Edenton, North Carolina** — Anglers wanting to try their luck at a couple of spots on Pembroke Creek may soon get the chance.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing allowing recreational fishing for all legal species in the creek from the boardwalk on the hatchery as well as the shoreline adjacent to the hatchery’s water intake.

The areas would be open for anglers when the hatchery is open. Its daily hours are 7 a.m - 3:30 p.m. including weekends and holidays, April through mid-December.

From mid-December through March the hatchery is typically closed on weekends and holidays. Anglers would access Pembroke Creek by walking north from the parking lot to the creek on the roads along the hatchery pond levees. All state of North Carolina fishing regulations would apply.

An opening date has not been set, but the areas should be open by late summer. public is encouraged to comment, preferably in writing. The draft [fishing plan](/pdf/plan/edenton-nfh-draft-fishing-plan.pdf) and [environmental assessment](/pdf/environmental-assessment/edenton-nfh-draft-environmental-assessment-fishing-plan.pdf) can be found in the hatchery office and online at [fws.gov/edenton/](https://www.fws.gov/edenton/)
