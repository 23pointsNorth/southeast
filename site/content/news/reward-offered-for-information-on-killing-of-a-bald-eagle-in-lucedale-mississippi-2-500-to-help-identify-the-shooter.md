A bald eagle was shot on February 10, 2012, in Lucedale, Mississippi. The shooting took place near the George County Co-Op. Investigators are seeking information related to the shooting. A joint investigation is being conducted by Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

“Every eagle, hawk, vulture, and crane is protected,” said Ben Bryant, Special Agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Lacombe, La. “There is no excuse for shooting them.”

Bald eagles are protected by the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

The Service is offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information that leads to a conviction.

Species information: Bald eagles take four to five years to mature, but many do not start breeding until they are much older. Bald eagles may live 15-25 years in the wild. They are opportunistic feeders with fish comprising most of their diet and are found around rivers and lakes. Bald eagles historically occurred from Mexico to Alaska.

Please contact: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Special Agent Ben Bryant at (985) 882-3756 or Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks at 1-800-Be-Smart with any information.
