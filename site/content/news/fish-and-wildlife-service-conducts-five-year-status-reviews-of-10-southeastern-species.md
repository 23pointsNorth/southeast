The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to conduct five-year status reviews of seven endangered and three threatened species occurring in one or more of 10 states.

These five-year reviews are conducted to ensure that listing classifications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are accurate. Any interested party is invited to provide information and comments pertaining to these species. Written comments and information related to these five-year reviews must be received on or before June 8, 2010.

This notice covers the following seven species federally listed as endangered:
 -[Mississippi sandhill crane](http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B04I)
 -[Alabama lampmussel](http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=F00A)
 -[Pondberry](http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=Q2CO)
 -[Louisiana quillwort](http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=S00T)

This notice also announces our active review of three species that are currently listed as threatened:
 - [Yellow-blotched map turtle](http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=C025)

Specifically, this review seeks information on: (1) species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; (2) habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; (3) conservation measures that have been implemented; (4) threat status and trends; and (5) other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five-year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress. It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts. Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.

The _Federal Register_ notice announcing the status review of these 10 federally listed species is available on-line at [http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2010/2010-8103.html](http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2010/2010-8103.html)
