The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced today a northern pintail was selected to appear on the 2012-2013 Federal Junior Duck Stamp. The design for the new stamp, painted by Christine Clayton, was chosen by a panel of judges at the national Junior Duck Stamp Art Contest, held at the Patuxent Research Refuge in Laurel, Md.

“I congratulate our winning artist and all of the talented young people who participate in the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program each year,” said Dan Ashe, Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “Now in its twentieth year, the Junior Duck Stamp Competition is the culmination of a year-long Junior Duck Stamp conservation program used by educators across the nation to connect youth with nature and inspire budding wildlife artists.”

The oil painting, which won the Ohio Junior Duck Stamp Contest, was judged the winner among Best-of-Show entries from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Proceeds from sales of the Junior Duck Stamp -- which the Service sells for $5 -- support environmental education.

Matthew Messina of Avon, Conn., took second place with an oil painting depicting a single wood duck.  Third place went to Hyun Wang for his rendition of a pair of hooded mergansers.  The 2012 Federal Junior Duck Stamp Conservation Message Contest winner was 15-year-old Amarylis Montalvo from Puerto Rico, with her entry: “Valora Proteje y Preserva su Habitat” (“Appreciate, Protect and Preserve Your Habitat”).

The Junior Duck Stamp Contest winner receives $5,000\. The second place winner receives $3,000, the third-place winner receives $2,000 and the Conservation Message winner receives $500.  The Service is pleased to announce that this year’s awards were provided through the generosity of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of SWIFT, a provider of secure financial messaging services.

Judges for this year's national Junior Duck Stamp Design Contest were the 2012-2013 Federal Duck Stamp artist, Joseph Hautman; Don Messersmith, a retired professor of Entomology, Ornithology and Environmental Education at the University of Maryland; Chandler Robbins, retired biologist from the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and an expert in bird conservation ecology and migration; Donnie Satchell, owner of Satchell’s Remodeling in Easton, Md., and a committee co-chair at the Easton Waterfowl Festival; and Frances Sweet, an award-winning wildlife artist.

The First Day of Sale Ceremony for the 2012-2013 Federal and Junior Duck Stamps will be held June 29, at the Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World in Hampton, Va.  The event is free and open to the public. Both the Federal and Junior Duck Stamp artists will be available to sign stamps, and the U.S. Postal Service will have a special cancellation for collectors.
