The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will conduct five-year status reviews of 12 endangered and two threatened species occurring in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The public is invited to provide information and comments concerning these species on or before October 18, 2016.

These five-year reviews will ensure listing classifications under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are accurate.  In addition to reviewing the classification of these species, a five--year review presents an opportunity to track the species’ recovery progress.  It may benefit species by providing valuable information to guide future conservation efforts.  Information gathered during a review can assist in making funding decisions, consideration related to reclassifying species status, conducting interagency consultations, making permitting decisions, and determining whether to update recovery plans, and other actions under the ESA.

This notice announces a review of two birds, two boas, and eight plants currently listed as endangered:  Yellow-shouldered blackbird, Puerto Rican plain pigeon, Puerto Rican boa, Virgin Islands boa, and the plants _Auerodendron pauciflorum_, _Catesbaea melanocarpa_, _Elaphoglossum serpens_, _Mitracarpus maxwelliae_, _M. polycladus_, _Polystichum calderonense_, _Tectaria estremerana_, and bariaco (_Trichilia triacantha_).

This notice also announces the Service’s review of two species currently listed as threatened: Guajón, a frog, and Higo chumbo, a cactus.  

Specifically, this review seeks information on: species biology, including population trends, distribution, abundance, demographics, and genetics; habitat conditions, including amount, distribution, and suitability; conservation measures that have been implemented; threat status and trends; and other new information, data, or corrections, including taxonomic or nomenclatural changes; identification of erroneous information contained in the ESA list; and improved analytical methods.

Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment.

[The _Federal Register_ notice announcing the status review of these 14 federally listed species is available on-line.](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/08/22/2016-19940/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-5-year-status-reviews-of-14-caribbean-species)
