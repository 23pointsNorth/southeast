**Mt. Pleasant, Georgia** – On Monday, October 16, the Department of Natural Resources will hold a ribbon cutting ceremony to announce the acquisition of the final phase of more than 19,000 acres purchased for the Sansavilla Wildlife Management Area.

Featuring 12 miles of Altamaha River frontage and one of the largest gopher tortoise populations in Georgia, the area provides fishing opportunities, wildlife watching locations, canoeing, boating, and hunting for deer, turkey, and small game species.

Cobbling together 40 miles of Atlamaha River corridor cost nearly $100 million over a dozen years. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, largely through bird and wetlands conservation grants, contributed roughly $20 million.
