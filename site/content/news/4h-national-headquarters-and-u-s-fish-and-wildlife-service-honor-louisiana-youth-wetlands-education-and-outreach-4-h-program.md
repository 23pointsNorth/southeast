The 4-H National Headquarters and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service presented the 2011 Connecting Youth with Nature through Natural Resources Conservation Education Award to the Louisiana State University AgCenter’s 4-H Youth Wetlands Program at the 76th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference being held in Missouri.

The 4-H Youth Wetlands Program has approximately 85,000 students enrolled in their educational and outreach program in Louisiana. By developing and distributing wetland education curriculum and teaching materials at no cost to participating educators, this program strives to implement wetlands education in the classroom as well as in the field. Students learn about water quality, invasive species, biodiversity, recreation, adaptations, wetland lost, and many more pressing wetland topics. Youth are empowered to contribute ideas and make decisions that will aid in the recovery of Louisiana’s deteriorating coastline. Since January 2010, youth participants have installed approximately 50,000 wetland plants across Louisiana to combat wetland loss.

“The Service is proud to recognize the efforts of the 4-H Youth Wetlands Education and Outreach Program with the 2011 Connecting Youth with Nature Award. The program provides an opportunity for Louisiana’s youth to get outdoors and contribute to projects benefiting fish and wildlife habitats while gaining exposure to career choices in natural resources management, ” said Jay Slack, Director of the Service’s National Conservation Training Center.

4-H National Headquarters recently recognized the 4-H Youth Wetlands Program as a Program of Distinction, which is required for consideration for this annual interagency conservation award. Programs of Distinction reflect the highest quality 4-H youth development programs found in communities across the United States.

The award program was initiated in 1980 to recognize 4-H volunteer leaders from across the country who assist youth in learning about wildlife and fisheries conservation and management. The Wildlife Management Institute, the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the Boone and Crockett Club also support the award program.
