The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today proposed continuation of liberal hunting season lengths for the upcoming 2009-2010 late waterfowl seasons. Duck hunting season lengths would be 60 days in both the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, 74 days in the Central Flyway, and 107 days in the Pacific Flyway. Highlights of the proposed frameworks include: a full season on pintails with a one bird daily bag limit in the Atlantic, Mississippi and Central Flyways, and a two bird daily bag limit in the Pacific Flyway and a full season on canvasbacks with a one bird daily bag limit offered nation-wide. Additionally, the Service is proposing to have a bag limit of 2 scaup in the Atlantic, Mississippi and Central Flyways for the full season and a bag limit of 3 scaup in the Pacific Flyway for 86 days.

States select their season and earliest season beginning and latest ending dates from within the frameworks which establish the maximum season length and bag limits.

The proposed late season waterfowl frameworks will appear in a mid-August edition of the _Federal Register_ for public comment and on [http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/fedreg/MGBHR.HTML](http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/fedreg/MGBHR.html).

Flyway-specific highlights of the proposed late-season frameworks are below:

**Atlantic Flyway** (Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia):

**Ducks**

**Geese**

**Mississippi**

**Flyway** (Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin):

**Ducks**

**Geese**: Generally, seasons for Canada geese would be held between September 26, 2009, and January 31, 2010, and vary in length among States and areas, with daily bag limits varying from one to three. States would be able to select seasons for light geese not to exceed 107 days with 20 geese daily between September 26, 2009, and March 10, 2010; for white-fronted geese the proposed season would not exceed 72 days with a two-bird daily bag limit or 86 days with a one-bird daily bag limit between September 26, 2009, and February 15, 2010; and for brant it would not exceed 70 days with a two-bird daily bag limit or 107 days with a one bird daily bag limit between September 26, 2009, and January 31, 2010\. There would be no possession limit for light geese.

**Central Flyway** (Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and portions of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming):

**Ducks**

**Geese**

**Pacific Flyway** (Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and portions of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming):

**Ducks**

**Geese**: 100-day seasons are proposed for the Pacific Flyway between September 26, 2009, and March 10, 2010\. Proposed basic daily bag limits are up to 10 light geese and four dark geese. There are exceptions to the basic bag limits and season structures for geese in many States, so consult State regulations for specific details. In California, Washington and Oregon, the dark goose limit does not include brant. For brant, the proposed season lengths are 16 days in Oregon and Washington and 30 days in California, with a two-bird daily limit. Washington and California would be able to choose seasons in each of the two zones.
