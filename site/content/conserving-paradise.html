  <h1>Conserving Paradise</h1>

  <p>Take a trip with us down the Altamaha River. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service traveled the river from Jesup in Southeast Georgia to the barrier islands where the free-flowing Altamaha empties into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

  <p>Along the way, we met federal and state biologists, non-profit conservationists, river-loving landowners, Marine Corps officials, outdoor enthusiasts, commercial fishermen and a fishmonger.</p>

  <p><strong>Dan Chapman</strong> wrote the stories. <strong>Nicole Vidal</strong> filmed the videos with the help of a camera-mounted drone piloted by <strong>Scott Bishaw</strong> and <strong>Jeff Lucas</strong>. <strong>Roy Hewitt</strong> pieced together the stories, videos and map to bring the Altamaha alive. <strong>Phil Kloer</strong> edited the stories. <strong>Katherine Taylor</strong> handled social media.</p>

  <p>We hope you enjoy it. Send comments to <a href='mailto:daniel_chapman@fws.gov?subject=Preserving+Paradise%3A+The+Altamaha+River'>daniel_chapman@fws.gov</a>.</p>

    <p>U.S. Marine Corps jets and helicopters rain thousand-pound bombs and 30-caliber bullets on a slice of the Altamaha River corridor.
