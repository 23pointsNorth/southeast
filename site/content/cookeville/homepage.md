The Tennessee Field Office, established in 1977, provides assistance to federal and state agencies, local governments, businesses, and the public to conserve and restore habitat for migratory birds and federally threatened and endangered species. Our assistance is typically provided through six programs: pre-development consultation, federal permits and projects, endangered species, environmental contaminants, partners for fish and wildlife, and education/outreach.

## Station goals

- Provide technical/financial assistance to private landowners interested in the conservation of migratory species and federally listed species.
- Provide accurate and meaningful assistance to help other federal agencies fulfill their responsibilities toward federally listed species.
- Provide assistance to state agencies and local governments in addressing federal mandates.
- Prevent, or identify and repair, harm or injury to trust resources caused by environmental contaminants.
- Provide for the recovery of endangered and threatened species.
