The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program to provide financial assistance to private landowners who are willing to work with us and other partners on a voluntary basis to help restore habitats that benefit our Federal Trust Species.  .  Restoring or enhancing habitats will substantially benefit federal trust species on private lands by providing food and cover or other essential needs.  With over 90% of Tennessee in private ownership, these landowners play a critical role in the recovery of Federal trust species.  Federal trust species  include threatened and endangered species, as well as migratory birds, inter-jusrisdictional fish, and other rare species.

## How Partners Works: a Timeline

- Interested landowners contact a Partners for Fish and Wildlife biologist to discuss the proposed project and establish a site visit.
- A visit to the site determines which activities the landowner desires and how those activities will enhance habitat for trust resources.
- The Service may provide technical advice on the proposed activities as appropriate.
- The Service and landowner discuss proposed cost estimates.
- The Service and landowner develop a detailed proposal which describes the proposed activities.  Because funding is competitive, the proposal is submitted to the Serviceâ€™s Regional Office for ranking and funding.
- After funding is approved for the project, the landowner and the Service enter into a Landowner Cooperative Agreement.
- Projects installation begins.
- The Service reimburses the landowner after receipts and other documentation are submitted according to the Landowner Cooperative  Agreement, when the project is completed.
