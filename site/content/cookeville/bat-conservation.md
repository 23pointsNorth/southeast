## White Nose Syndrome

White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease affecting hibernating bats. Named for the white fungus that appears on the muzzle and other parts of hibernating bats, WNS has caused extensive deaths of bats in eastern North America. First documented in New York in the winter of 2006-2007, WNS has spread rapidly across the eastern United States and Canada, and the fungus that causes WNS has been detected as far south as Mississippi and as far west as Washington state.

Bats with WNS act strangely during cold winter months, including flying outside in the day and clustering near the entrances of hibernacula (caves and mines where bats hibernate). Bats have been found sick and dying in unprecedented numbers in and around caves and mines. WNS has killed more than 5.7 million bats in eastern North America. In some hibernacula, 90 to 100 percent of bats have died.

Many laboratories and state and federal biologists are investigating the cause of the bat deaths. A fungus discovered in 2008, *Pseudogymnoascus destructans*, or pd, (formerly *Geomyces destructans*), has been demonstrated to cause WNS. Scientists are investigating the dynamics of fungal infection and transmission, and searching for a way to control it.

## Forest dwelling bats

### Indiana bat

The Indiana bat is a small bat with dark gray to blackish, brown fur, found across much of the eastern United States.  It is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  It was first listed as a result of large numbers of Indiana bat deaths caused by human disturbance during hibernation.

Indiana bats hibernate during winter in caves or, occasionally, in abandoned mines. For hibernation, they require cool, humid caves with stable temperatures, under 50° F but above freezing. Very few caves within the range of the species have these conditions.  However, Tennessee is a state rich in karst geology and with this geology comes many caves.

After hibernation, Indiana bats migrate to their summer habitat where they usually roost under loose tree bark on living, dead, or dying trees. During summer, males roost alone or in small groups, while females roost in larger groups of up to 100 bats or more. Indiana bats also forage in or along the edges of forested areas.  Summer records of Indiana bats, primarily gathered from mist-net surveys, have documented their presence in more than 21 Tennessee counties, which are well distributed across the state.  Due to this wide distribution in Tennessee and the frequent occurrence of suitable habitat conditions, the Service considers the Indiana bat to have the potential to occur anywhere in Tennessee that suitable habitat is present.

More information on the Indiana bat can be found by visiting the [Ecological Conservation Online System](http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A000) (ECOS) website for the Indiana bat or the [USFWS Region 3 Indiana bat website](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/mammals/inba/).

### Northern-long-eared bat

The northern long-eared bat was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act on April 2, 2015. At the same time the Service established an interim 4(d) rule that identified protections provided under the Act. The Service also opened a 90-day public comment period on the interim 4(d) rule. After reviewing comments the Service developed a final 4(d) rule, which was published in the Federal Register on January 14, 2016, and the rule went into effect on February 16, 2016.

**For all areas within the range of the northern long-eared bat, all purposeful take is prohibited except:**

- Removal of northern long-eared bats in defense of one’s own life or the lives of others, including for public health monitoring purposes (i.e., collecting a bat after human exposure and submitting for disease testing).
- Removal from human structures, but only if the actions comply with all applicable State regulations. The following are removal recommendations:
- Minimize use of pesticides (e.g., rodenticides) and avoid use of sticky traps as part of bat evictions/exclusions.
- Conduct exclusions during spring or fall unless there is a perceived public health concern from bats present during summer and/or winter.
- Contact a nuisance wildlife specialist for humane exclusion techniques.
- Removal of hazardous trees for protection of human life and property.
- Purposeful take that resulting from actions related to the capture handling, and related activities for northern long-eared bats by individuals permitted to conduct these same activities for other species of bats until May 3, 2016. After May 3, 2016, a permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the ESA is required for the capture and handling of northern long-eared bats, except for purposeful take associated with bat removal from human structures.

For areas of the country impacted by white-nose syndrome (such as Kentucky), the measures provided in the final 4(d) rule exempt take from the following activities:

1. Forest management practices,
2. Maintenance and limited expansion of transportation and utility rights-of-way,
3. Prairie habitat management,
4. Limited tree removal projects, provided these activities protect known roosts and hibernacula,

as long as these activities include these measures:

1. Activity occurs more than 0.25 mile (0.4 km) from a known, occupied hibernacula.
2. Activity avoids cutting or destroying known, occupied roost trees during the pup season (June 1–July 31).
3. Activity avoids clearcuts (and similar harvest methods, e.g. seed tree, shelterwood and coppice) within 150 feet (45.72 m) of known, occupied roost trees during the pup season (June 1–July 31).
