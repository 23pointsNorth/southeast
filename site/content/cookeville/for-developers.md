The Tennessee field office typically receives over 2,000 pre-development consultation requests each year.  The vast majority of requests involve corridor development, such as, pipelines and highways.  Many of the pipeline activities require stream crossings which potentially could impact aquatic resources including federally listed species.  However, most negative impacts can be significantly reduced by directional boring under the stream or mounting the pipeline from an existing bridge.  Most other aquatic impacts can be minimized by using best management practices relative to erosion control and re-vegetation of construction areas.  Highway projects reviewed are principally associated with bridge replacement or construction.

Some activities are pre-coordinated and communication with the Service is not necessary.  Review the information below to determine if your project is covered by either document.
