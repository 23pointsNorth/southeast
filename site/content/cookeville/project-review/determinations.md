The conclusion column in your species conclusion table should be filled in for all species/resources. Use Tables 1 and 2 below to assist you in completing the determination column. These tables show possible conclusions for each species/resource, and the resulting ESA Section 7 (Table 1) and Eagle Act (Table 2) determination based on your conclusions. We have provided two examples of completed species conclusions tables below.

If Table 1 indicates a "may affect" determination should be made, but you believe your action warrants “no effect” or “not likely to adversely affect”, please note your determination. In the notes/documentation column explain your rationale and describe any measures proposed to minimize or mitigate potential impacts.

## Table 1: ESA Section 7 Determination

Possible Conclusions                                      | ESA Section 7 Determination
----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Species not present                                       | No effect
No suitable habitat present                               | No effect
No critical habitat (designated/proposed) present         | No effect
Suitable habitat present, species not present             | Not likely to adversely affect
Species (listed/proposed) present                         | May affect
Potential habitat present and no current survey conducted | May affect
Critical habitat (designated/proposed) present            | May affect
Species present (candidate/species of concern only)       | Recommend coordination with our office to develop measures to avoid impacts

## Table 2: Eagle Act Determination

Possible Conclusions                    | Eagle Act Determination
----------------------------------------|---------------------------------
Unlikely to disturb nesting bald eagles | No Eagle Act permit required
May disturb nesting bald eagles         | Eagle Act permit may be required
