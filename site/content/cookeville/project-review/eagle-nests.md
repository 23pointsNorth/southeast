Bald eagles (*Haliaeetus leucocephalus*) are protected from take and disturbance by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (Eagle Act). Follow the steps below to determine if an Eagle Act permit is necessary. Under some circumstances the Eagle Act may allow take of bald and golden eagles with a permit. In Tennessee the bald eagle nesting (breeding) season is from December 15 through July 15.

1. Determine if the action area intersects with a bald eagle nest buffer by visualizing your project in the [bald eagle nest map](https://arcg.is/OyrzC). [Learn about how the Service provides technical assistance to project developers](/our-services/eagle-technical-assistance/) including how construction, timber, aircraft, blasting and vehicles can impact eagles during nesting season.

    - If the action area is not within 660 feet of a bald eagle nest, add "bald eagle" to the species/resource name column and add "unlikely to disturb nesting bald eagles" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table. Continue to Step 7a.
    - If the action area is within 660 feet of a bald eagle nest, determine whether the proposed action may disturb the nesting eagle by following the steps in the Service's [Southeast Region bald eagle management guidelines and conservation measures](/our-services/eagle-technical-assistance/?visible-nest=on&similar-activity=on) web review process.

2. If you are able to implement the recommendations in the guidelines, add "bald eagle" to the species/resource name column and add "unlikely to disturb nesting bald eagles" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table. Document recommendations you adopted to avoid disturbance in the notes/documentation column of the species conclusions table, and add any additional documents/documentation to the project review package. Continue to Step 7a.

3. If you are unable to implement the recommendations in the guidelines, add "bald eagle" to the species/resource name column and add "may disturb nesting bald eagles" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table. Provide an explanation of why the recommendations cannot be implemented in the notes/documentation column of the species conclusions table, and add this to the project review package. Continue to Step 7a.
