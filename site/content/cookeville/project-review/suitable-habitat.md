Determine whether listed, proposed, or candidate species may occur based on the habitat present within the action area for each species in your conclusions table. Review the species information provided by IPaC, TDEC and TWRA, and any other sources of information (e.g., habitat assessments) available to determine whether the action area contains suitable habitat for each species. Habitat assessments or surveys must be conducted by an approved surveyor. Refer to the [optimal survey times for plants](/pdf/fact-sheet/tennessee-optimal-plant-survey-windows.pdf) for additional guidance.

If you have a previous survey of your site, consult the guidelines for survey expiration for plants and animals. Surveys are valid for a certain period of time based on the species' life history. If your existing survey is no longer valid or the survey does not include the entire action area, obtain a new survey.

1. If you can confirm suitable habitat is absent from the action area, add "no suitable habitat present" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table for the appropriate species and document what sources you consulted and why you reached that conclusion in the notes/documentation column. Add this documentation to your project review package.

2. If there may be suitable habitat for a listed, proposed, or candidate species or if you are uncertain about whether the habitat types may support a species, a detailed habitat assessment is recommended. If the habitat assessment concludes suitable habitat is absent, add "no suitable habitat present" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table for the appropriate species, and include why you reached that conclusion in the notes/documentation column. Add the habitat assessment to the project review package.

3. If suitable habitat occurs within the action area, species surveys are recommended. **Please contact the Tennessee Field Office for a list of approved surveyors.**

  - If surveys indicate species are absent from the action area, add "suitable habitat present, species not present" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table for the appropriate species. Add the survey report to the project review package.
  - If surveys document that a species is present, add "species present" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table for the appropriate species. Add the survey report to the project review package.

4. If surveys are not conducted and potential habitat occurs with action area, add "potential habitat present and no current survey conducted" to the conclusion column in the species conclusions table for the appropriate species.

Conclusions should be filled in for all species at this point. If there are species on your list without conclusions, return to step 3 and continue through the review process until you have the appropriate conclusion for each species.

When all conclusions are complete, continue to [step 5](/cookeville/project-review/critical-habitat).
