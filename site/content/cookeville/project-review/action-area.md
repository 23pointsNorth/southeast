Determine your projects proposed action area with the instructions below.  The action area will be drawn in step 2 using the Service's Information, Planning and Consultation system (IPaC). Failure to correctly define the action area as instructed will result in incorrect outcomes that may not comply with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

## Defining the action area

The action area is defined by regulation as all areas that will be affected, directly or indirectly, by the project and not merely the immediate area involved in the action (50 CFR ยง402.02). The action area is not limited to the "footprint" of the action nor is it limited by the federal agency's authority.

To determine the action area, mark the project footprint on a topographic map. Identify the range of impacts such as:

- Ground disturbance (including access roads)
- Changes in water quality and quantity (both surface and underground water)
- Air quality
- Lighting effects
- Noise disturbance
