Federally designated Critical Habitat occurs in over half the counties in Tennessee.

1. If the project action area occurs within any of these counties, use the Service’s [Critical Habitat mapper](http://fws.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=9d8de5e265ad4fe09893cf75b8dbfb77) to determine if the action area intersects federally designated critical habitat. [Read the instructions for locating your project area in the map tool. Learn more about Critical Habitat in the Southeast](https://www.fws.gov/cookeville/pdfs/crithab_mapper_instructions.pdf).

2. If the project action area intersects critical habitat, add "critical habitat" to the species/resource name column of the species conclusion table. Note which species critical habitat is present in the conclusion column. [Continue to step 6](/cookeville/project-review/eagle-nests).

3. If the project action area does not occur within these counties, add "critical habitat" to the species/resource name column in the species conclusions table, and add “no critical habitat present”. [Continue to step 6](/cookeville/project-review/eagle-nests).
