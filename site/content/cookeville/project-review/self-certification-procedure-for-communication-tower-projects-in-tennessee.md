To streamline the review process for communications tower projects, we have developed avoidance and minimization measures, no effect criteria, and procedures for project review. The guidance takes into consideration available information on migratory birds, federally protected species, critical habitat, and bald eagles.This process also provides information for your project review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969.

## Step 1: Migratory birds

To minimize adverse impacts to migratory birds, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) strongly encourages co-locating with other equipment and/or lowering tower height to the extent practicable, minimizing lighting, locating the tower in urbanized or developed areas or other areas that do not provide potential habitat for migratory birds, and incorporating as many recommendations from the Service Guidance on the Siting, Construction, Operation and Decommissioning of Communication Towers as possible.

## Step 2: Threatened, endangered species and bald eagles

The following types of proposed actions will have "no effect" on federally proposed/listed threatened or endangered species, federally designated critical habitat, and are unlikely to disturb bald eagles:

1. Co-location of new equipment or antennae or any infrastructure improvements at an existing structure (tower, water tank, building, etc.) where all ground disturbance occurs within cleared or regularly mowed areas.
2. Routine maintenance or repair of existing towers or their sites.
3. Transfer of ownership of existing towers.

## Step 3: Self certify

For projects that meet the criteria in steps one and two, no further coordination with the Service is needed. Complete the self-certification letter and submit electronically to [TFOProjectReview@fws.gov](mailto:TFOProjectReview@fws.gov).  Please indicate in your email subject that you are submitting an "online project review certification letter." All project reviews will receive a return receipt to inform you that your project has been successfully submitted to the office.

## Step 4: Follow general guidelines

If the project does not meet the criteria in Step two, follow the project review guidelines for other projects.
