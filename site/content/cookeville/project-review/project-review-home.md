This online project review process is intended for use by landowners, applicants, consultants, agency personnel, and any other individual or entity requiring U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) review or approval of their project in Tennessee. Please complete this process before contacting our office.

This step-by-step guidance will help you identify threatened and endangered species, designated critical habitat, and other federal trust resources that may be affected by your project. You will be able to assess whether your project is likely to affect these resources.
If upon completion of this process you determine that your project is unlikely to affect federal trust resources you can certify your determination and no further coordination will be required. If your project may affect these resources, the review package developed through the process will expedite further review when it is submitted to our office.

Please refer to the website for each project review to ensure that you’re using current information.

## Wind energy

For wind energy projects follow the online project review process and submit the completed project review package to this office for review regardless of the outcome in the species conclusion table. Additional review will be necessary to evaluate the project's potential impacts.

For land based wind energy projects, the Service has developed [voluntary guidelines](https://www.fws.gov/ecological-services/es-library/pdfs/WEG_final.pdf) to help wind energy project developers avoid and minimize impacts on wildlife and their habitats.  The Service encourages you to use these voluntary guidelines and when submitting your package to this office. Please provide detailed information on how you have applied the guidelines. Learn more about [wind energy development](https://www.fws.gov/windenergy/).

## Coal mining

For coal mining projects contact Dustin Boles, [dustin_boles@fws.gov](mailto:dustin_boles@fws.gov), at the Tennessee Field Office.

## Communications towers

For communication tower projects follow the self certification procedure.

## Wetlands

For information related to the possible presence of wetlands within a project action area, please visit the Service’s [National Wetland Inventory Wetlands Mapper](https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Mapper.html).

Please note that the map products in Wetlands Mapper were neither designed nor intended to represent legal or regulatory products.  Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over wetlands (Army Corps of Engineers and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation) may define and describe wetlands in a different manner than that used in the Wetlands Mapper inventory.   Detailed on-the-ground inspection of any particular site may be needed.  Persons intending to engage in activities involving modifications within or adjacent to wetland areas should seek the advice of appropriate federal, state, or local agencies concerning specified agency regulatory programs and proprietary jurisdictions that may affect such activities.

## All other projects

For all other project types, the following guidelines will allow you to conduct a review of a project's potential impacts on federally threatened and endangered and proposed species, [at-risk species](/endangered-species-act/at-risk-species/), [critical habitat](/endangered-species-act/critical-habitat/), and [bald eagles](/our-services/permits/eagles/).  At the end of this review process you will be able to:

1. certify that you have completed required coordination with the Service under the ESA, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act; or
2. expedite additional review by the Service.  This process also provides information for your project review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

To comply with applicable state laws and obtain information on state listed or other rare species contact the [Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation - Natural Areas](https://tn.gov/assets/entities/environment/attachments/pol_dna_environmental_consultation.pdf).

To begin project review proceed to Step 1.
