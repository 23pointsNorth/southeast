In 2015, [the Service listed the Northern long-eared bat (*Myotis septentrionalis*, NLEB) as threatened](https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ref=u.s.-fish-and-wildlife-service-protects-northern-long-eared-bat-as-&_ID=34833) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In 2016, [the Service published a final 4(d) rule and Intra-Service Programmatic Biological Opinion](https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ref=protections-finalized-for-threatened-northern-long-eared-bats-&_ID=35436), which provide a mechanism for section 7 compliance for many federal actions.

## Final 4(d) Rule

A 4(d) Rule is one of many tools of the ESA for protecting species listed as threatened. This rule gets its name from section 4(d) of the ESA, which directs the Service to issue regulations deemed “necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of threatened species.”

Typically the Service uses 4(d) rules to incentivize positive conservation actions and streamline the regulatory process for minor impacts. As a part of those goals, the rule is often used to clarify or simplify what forms of take of a threatened species are and are not prohibited. Without a 4(d) special rule, threatened species receive the same protections as endangered species.

The final 4(d) rule prohibits all **purposeful** take except:

- Removal of NLEBs from human structures;
- defense of human life (e.g., public health monitoring for rabies); and
- removal of hazardous trees for protection of human life and property.

The final 4(d) rule prohibits the following **incidental** take in areas of the country inside the white-nose syndrome (WNS) zone, which includes all of Tennessee:

- Incidental take that occurs within a hibernaculum. This may include disturbing hibernating individuals or alteration of the hibernaculum’s entrance or environment when bats are not present if the activity will impair essential behavioral patterns, including sheltering.
- Incidental take caused by tree removal that occurs in specific locations:
  - Within 0.25 mile of a known hibernaculum, at any time of year.
  - Within a 150-foot radius of a known occupied maternity roost tree during the pup season (June 1 - July 31).

All other incidental take is allowed. Learn more about the [NLEB listing and final 4(d) rule](http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/mammals/nleb/).

## Project Review Guidance

If you are coordinating on a previously consulted project:

- If a time-of-year restriction (TOYR) or surveys were recommended or you self-certified based on a self-imposed TOYR, you are encouraged to continue to implement the previous informal consultation. If your project overlaps with the Indiana bat (*Myotis sodalis*) and a TOYR was recommended for both species, the TOYR for the Indiana bat remains.

### Non-federal actions

If you do not have any other species on your official species list, you do not need to contact the Service. [Download the flowchart for non-federal actions](/pdf/guidelines/northern-long-eared-bat-non-federal-action-flowchart.pdf).

### Federal actions

The lead federal agency will need to re-submit the project materials in accordance with the steps below. This will serve as the written notification per the framework described in the [2016 Programmatic Biological Opinion](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/mammals/nleb/pdf/BOnlebFinal4d.pdf) on the Final 4(d) rule for the NLEB. If you received a federal permit, coordination should be conducted by the lead federal agency. Please update your official species list, do not create a new list. [Download the flowchart for federal agency actions](/pdf/guidelines/northern-long-eared-bat-federal-action-flowchart.pdf).

### If this is a new consultation

Determine if your action area intersects with an area where incidental take is not allowed under the final 4(d) rule. The [Tennessee northern long-eared bat map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=ed3d08139be74f45b4f1eb6da4bfbb6f&extent=-89.1378,33.9324,-81.0244,37.6777) provides documented maternity areas and hibernacula in Tennessee. We will coordinate with you to determine if your project meets the criteria of the final 4(d) rule in regards to impacts to hibernacula.

Is your project within a NLEB location identified within buffers on the Tennessee Northern long-eared bat map?

- **No:** If you do not have any other species on your official species list, you do not need to contact the Service.
- **Yes:** Submit your project (via the Review Request Letter) for further review.

## Example of Species Conclusion Table

Species/Resource Name   | Conclusion                                                             | ESA Section 7/Eagle Act Determination | Notes
------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------
Northern long-eared bat | A documented maternity colony or hibernacula may be in the action area | May affect                            |

The Service will review your project and advise if an incidental take permit is required.

We strongly encourage non-federal project proponents to implement the voluntary NLEB conservation measures listed below.

## [Federal agency actions (flowchart)](/pdf/guidelines/northern-long-eared-bat-federal-action-flowchart.pdf)

Federal agencies have 3 scenarios by which they may comply with section 7 of the ESA for the NLEB for actions that do not result in incidental take prohibited by the 4(d) rule:

1. **Not likely to adversely affect** by implementing a time-of-year restriction (TOYR) on tree clearing or having negative survey results; or
2. **Not likely to adversely affect** by implementing other applicable informal programmatic consultations, such as the FHWA Indiana bat/NLEB rangewide programmatic consultation; or
3. **May affect** but implementing the Service’s Programmatic Biological Opinion for the final 4(d) rule.

### May affect - not likely to adversely affect

<div id="step-1"></div>

Step 1. Is your project within a NLEB location identified on the [Tennessee Northern Long-eared Bat map](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=ed3d08139be74f45b4f1eb6da4bfbb6f&extent=-89.1378,33.9324,-81.0244,37.6777)?

- **No:** Go to [Step 2](#step-2).
- **Yes:** Go to [Step 5](#step-5).

<div id="step-2"></div>

Step 2. Will the project include a TOYR for tree clearing (April 15 - September 15) for tree clearing that is not substantial acreage or do you have negative NLEB survey results or the project does not impact suitable habitat?

- **No:** Go to [Step 3](#step-3).
- **Yes:**  Submit a Self-Certification Letter. Use the example below to assist you in filling out the SCT.

## Example of Self-Certification Letter SCT

Species/Resource Name   | Conclusion               | ESA Section 7/Eagle Act Determination    | Notes
------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Northern long-eared bat | Suitable habitat present | No Effect/Not Likely to Adversely Affect | Implementing a TOYR (April 15 - Sept 15) for tree clearing that is not substantial acreage OR Survey conducted and no bats were documented.

### May affect - not likely to adversely affect

<div id="step-3"></div>

Step 3. Will you be implementing a previously completed informal consultation with the Service on the NLEB?

- **No:** Go to [Step 4](#step-4).
- **Yes:** Submit a Self-Certification Letter. Use the example below to assist you in filling out the SCT.

The following agencies have completed programmatic consultations with the Service:

- [Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Transit Administration](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/section7/fhwa/index.html)

## Example of Self-Certification Letter SCT

Species/Resource Name   | Conclusion               | ESA Section 7/Eagle Act Determination | Notes
------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Northern long-eared bat | Suitable habitat present | Not Likely to Adversely Affect        | Implementing the conservation measures as outlined in the informal programmatic consultation (cite the completed informal programmatic consultation, including the date).

<div id="step-4"></div>

Step 4. Will you be relying upon the findings the 1/5/2016 Programmatic Biological Opinion on Final 4(d) rule for the Northern Long-Eared Bat and Activities Excepted from Take Prohibitions to fulfill your project-specific section 7 responsibilities?

- **No:** Go to [Step 5](#step-5).
- **Yes:** Submit a Self-Certification Letter. Use the example below to assist you in filling out the SCT.

The programmatic biological opinion requires federal agencies provide us written notification of their section 7 determination for the NLEB (project submittal) at least 30 days in advance of funding, authorizing, or carrying out an action. The federal agency must provide its determination as part of coordination/consultation for other listed species. **Also include the number of acres of habitat impacted and how it will be impacted (e.g., trees clearing, prescribed fire, install wind turbines).** The Service is not required to provide concurrence on your NLEB section 7 determination. If the Service does not respond within 30 days, the federal agency may presume its determination is informed by best available information and consider its project responsibilities under section 7(a)(2) with respect to NLEB fulfilled through the programmatic biological opinion.

## Example of Self-Certification Letter SCT

Species/Resource Name   | Conclusion               | ESA Section 7/Eagle Act Determination | Notes
------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Northern long-eared bat | Suitable habitat present | May affect                            | Relying upon the findings of the 1/5/2016 Programmatic Biological Opinion for Final 4(d) Rule on the Northern Long-Eared Bat and Activities Excepted from Take Prohibitions to fulfill our project-specific section 7 responsibilities.

We strongly encourage Federal action agencies to implement the NLEB voluntary conservation measures listed below.

<div id="step-5"></div>

Step 5. Submit your project (via the Review Request Letter) for further review.

## Example of Review Request Letter SCT

Species/Resource Name   | Conclusion                                                             | ESA Section 7/Eagle Act Determination | Notes
------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------
Northern long-eared bat | A documented maternity colony or hibernacula may be in the action area | May affect                            |

The Service will review your project and advise if further consultation is required.

## Voluntary Conservation Measures

We strongly encourage all federal agencies to fulfill their section 7(a)(1) obligations by carrying out the conservation measures listed below. We also strongly encourage non-federal project proponents to implement the following conservation measures:

- Perform NLEB surveys according to the most recent summer survey guidelines.
- Conduct tree removal activities outside of the NLEB pup season (June 1-July 31) and/or the active season (April 15-September 15).
- Avoid clearing suitable spring staging and fall swarming habitat within a 5-mile radius of known or assumed NLEB hibernacula during the spring staging and fall swarming season (April 1-May 14 and August 16-November 15).
- Manage forests to ensure a continual supply of snags and other suitable maternity roosts trees.
- Conduct prescribed burns outside of the pup season (June 1-July 31) and/or the active season (April 1-October 31). Avoid high-intensity burns (causing tree scorch higher than NLEB roosting heights) during the summer maternity season to minimize direct impacts to NLEB.
- Perform bridge repair, retrofit, maintenance, and/or rehabilitation work outside of the NLEB active season (April 15-September 15) in areas where NLEB are known to roost on bridges or where such use is likely.
- Do not use military smoke and obscurants within forested suitable
- NLEB habitat during the pup season (June 1-July 31) and/or the active season (April 15-September 15).
- Minimize use of herbicides and pesticides. If necessary, spot treatment is preferred over aerial application.
- Evaluate the use of outdoor lighting during the active season and seek to minimize light pollution by angling lights downward or via other light minimization measures.
- Participate in actions to manage and reduce the impacts of WNS on NLEBs. Actions needed to investigate and manage WNS are described in a national plan the Service developed in coordination with other state and federal agencies.
