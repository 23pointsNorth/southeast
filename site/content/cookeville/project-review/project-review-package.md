1. If the ESA section 7 determination for any species or critical habitat is "may affect" (except the NLEB) or the Eagle Act determination is "Eagle Act permit may be required," submit the project review package to this office for review. Attach the Review Request Letter (MS Word Format) and ensure you provide all requested information as indicated in table below.  We will respond when we receive a complete project review package.

2. If the ESA section 7 determination for all species (except the NLEB under the final 4(D) rule) and critical habitat is either “no effect” or “not likely to adversely affect” and the Eagle Act determination is “no Eagle Act permit required,” print the Self-Certification Letter (PDF). Federal agencies are not required to contact the Service or provide documentation for "no effect" and/or "no Eagle Act permit required" determinations. For "not likely to adversely affect" determinations," federal agencies are required to submit a copy of the online project review certification letter and the project review package with all requested information as indicated in table below to complete consultation requirements. Regardless of the determination, non-federal applicants must submit a copy of this letter and the project review package for this certification to be valid.
