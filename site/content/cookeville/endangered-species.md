In 1973, Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) recognizing that:

1. various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States have been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation;
2. other species of fish, wildlife and plants have been so depleted in numbers that they are in danger of or threatened with extinction, and
3. these species of fish, wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the United States and its people.

The ESA provides a means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered  and threatened species depend, a means for the conservation and recovery of those species.

Important components of the ESA include:

## Section 4

Section 4 provides the process by which species are added to or removed from the official list of endangered or threatened species, and by which recovery plans are developed;

## Section 6

Section 6 allows the Service to enter into cooperative agreements with states to implement recovery activities.

## Section 7

Section 7 requires all federal agencies to consult with the Service for all actions they authorize, fund, or carry out regarding ESA protected species.

## Section 9

Section 9 prohibits take of listed species and provides penalties for violations.

## Section 10

Section 10 allows the Service to issue permits for incidental take of listed species for scientific purposes, or through the development of habitat conservation plans (HCP's) by non-federal entities.

The Tennessee Field Office is actively involved in Section 7 consultations and Section 4 listing and recovery activities. Tennessee currently or historically has provided habitat for around 100 species of threatened or endangered plants or animals.
