## Where can I purchase a hunting or fishing license in Tennessee?

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service does not issue hunting or fishing licenses. To purchase a [hunting](https://www.tn.gov/twra/license-sales.html) or [fishing](https://www.tn.gov/twra/license-sales/fishing-licenses.html) license in Tennessee visit the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.

## There is an injured or orphaned animal in my backyard. Whom should I contact?

We often receive phone calls from concerned individuals asking what to do with an injured or baby animal they have discovered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service does not provide wildlife rehabilitation or nuisance wildlife capture services. Our role is to provide permits to those who rehabilitate endangered, threatened, or otherwise federally protected species, like migratory birds.

[Learn more about injured and orphaned animals](https://www.fws.gov/southeast/wildlife-and-you/injured-or-orphaned-animals/) or contact a [Tennessee wildlife rehabilitator](https://www.tn.gov/twra/article/wildlife-rehabilitator-list).
