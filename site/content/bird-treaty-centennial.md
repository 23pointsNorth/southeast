Just thirteen years after Teddy Roosevelt set aside Pelican Island as the first National Wildlife Refuge, on August 16, 1916, the United States signed a treaty with Canada—the very first of its kind—to protect our shared migratory birds from overconsumption.

The refuge system and the modern conservation movement were in their infancy. This treaty helped set the foundation for future treaties and laws to help conserve migratory birds. The treaty also set the stage for the creation of the Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency nation’s trust resources.

One hundred years later, our treaty agreements to protect and manage shared bird species continue to provide the foundation for bird conservation throughout the Service and the conservation community.

## Why Do Migratory Birds Matter?

{{< figure class="photo" src="/images/pages/prothonotary-warbler.jpg" alt="A small, bright yellow bird perched on a tree branch" link="https://flic.kr/p/na9weZ" caption="A prothonotary warbler, photo by USFWS." >}}

Birds connect people with nature, adding beauty, sound, and color to our world. They provide countless opportunities for enjoyment by birders, hunters, and outdoor enthusiasts and have cultural and spiritual importance.

Studying birds can give us a picture of what is going on in the world because they are good indicators of environmental health. Visible and relatively easy to study, birds also contribute to the health of our environment by pollinating plants, eating insects and rodents, and dispersing seeds.

Birds also play a key role in contributing to the U.S. economy, supporting recreational opportunities that create jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue.
