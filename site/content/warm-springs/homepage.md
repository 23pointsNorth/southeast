Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery was authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1898 and was established in 1899 as a warmwater hatchery. The species propagated here do best in spring and summer water temperatures of 60-85 degrees Fahrenheit. Species such as striped bass, lake sturgeon, robust redhorse and alligator gar are vital fishery resources of the southeastern United States and are managed in cooperation with state game and fish agencies.

The hatchery consists of 56 acres with 40 ponds totaling 18.23 acres of water, and is managed by a staff that includes four biologists and an electrician. The hatcheryâ€™s primary work area is Georgia, but also benefits species throughout the 10-state U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southeast Region.
