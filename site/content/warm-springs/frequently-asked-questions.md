## Where does water for hatchery operations come from?

Water for station operations originates from several springs on station. Water from Cold Springs is shared with the town of Warm Springs. This water flows out of the ground at a constant temperature of 17 degrees centigrade year-round. Water leaving the station eventually runs into the Flint River.

## How are the ponds and tanks used?

Each of the 40 ponds on station has an individual fresh water supply and drain. They range in size from 0.1 to 1.6 surface acres. Many of the ponds now have electrical outlets for power equipment and have full-time supplemental aeration available. All ponds have a sloped bottom allowing water and fish to be concentrated in harvesting basins when they are drained. The hatchery also has hatching jars, aquariums, tanks and cages of various capacities for hatching and rearing aquatic species.

These facilities are used to culture a variety of aquatic species such as striped bass for eventual distribution. The facilities may, however, be used to evaluate new hatchery techniques for species under culture which may not yet be stocked into public waters.

## Is the hatchery open to the public?

Yes, our facilities include a public aquarium and displays that highlight the work done on station and by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Groups can learn about hatchery operations and resource issues during visits.

## Why do we need federal hatcheries and who pays for them?

National  fish hatcheries are supported by tax dollars. Fish raised on federal hatcheries are stocked in public waters to support federal fishery responsibilities mandated by law. These include fish for restoration where, for example, habitat degradation has altered a stream’s natural reproductive capability; or to restore threatened or endangered populations. Fish are also used to support recreational fishing programs in federal and state waters.

## Does the hatchery sell fish?

No fish were ever sold from this facility. In past years the hatchery partnered with the USDA in providing stockable fingerlings through the Farm Pond Program. Although once a primary role of the National Fish Hatchery System, the farm pond program is no longer a responsibility of the Service. In 1989, the farm pond program was officially ended, and hatchery production was shifted more to threatened/endangered species and the restoration of fisheries population in public waters. A list is available at the hatchery of local and statewide fish farmers that can provide fish for private ponds.

## Where can I purchase a fishing license?

The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service does not issue fishing licenses. To review Georgia fishing regulations and to purchase a license, please contact the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife Resources Division at 1-800-366-2661 or [visit them online](https://georgiawildlife.com/licenses-permits-passes).
