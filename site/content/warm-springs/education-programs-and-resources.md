The Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery offers several opportunities for your family or class to enjoy nature and get outdoors. Throughout the year, we provide events including Kids Fish for Fun in June and an open house in October. Come visit our facility and enjoy a hike on our nature trail, bird watching, view wildlife in our display ponds, and learn about fish and wildlife in our public aquarium.

## Scout troops

Please contact the hatchery to coordinate so that we can help your troop achieve your goals of volunteer service.

## Additional resources

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offers other ways for children, parents, and formal and non-formal educators to explore learning and teaching opportunities about fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats and how you can help conserve, protect, and enhance them.
