The Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery offers several opportunities for your family or class to enjoy nature and get outdoors. Throughout the year, we provide events including Kids Fish for Fun (June) and an open house (September). Come visit our facility and enjoy a hike on our nature trail, bird watching, view wildlife in our display ponds, and learn about fish and wildlife in our public aquarium.

## Biologist in training program

The hatchery is presenting an exciting new program that offers children a chance to interact with fish and their aquatic habitats. The [Biologist-in-Training](/biologist-in-training/) (BiT) program is an environmental education curriculum that utilizes national fish hatcheries and streams, lakes, ponds and rivers as outdoor classrooms.

## Scout troops
The hatchery also offers scout troops an opportunity to earn patches and learn about fish and wildlife. We will work with scout troops to help achieve their goals of volunteer service. A new opportunity to earn patches is offered by [Take Me Fishing](https://www.takemefishing.org/) and three new patches are available for scouts to earn:

- Passport Patch- introduction to fishing and boating for scouts ages 6 to 11
- First Catch Patch- real-life fishing trip for scouts ages 6 to 11
- Mentor Patch- mentor newcomers to fishing for scouts ages 12 to 17

## Additional resources

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offers other ways for children, parents, and formal and non-formal educators to explore learning and teaching opportunities about fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats and how you can help conserve, protect, and enhance them.
