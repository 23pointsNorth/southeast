Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery is always seeking qualified volunteers and interns to help with daily operations and projects. Our volunteers are individuals who want to give back to their communities, parents who want to be good stewards of the land and set examples for their children, retired people willing to share their wealth of knowledge, concerned citizens of all ages who want to learn more about conservation, and passionate people who enjoy the outdoors and want to spread the word about America's greatest natural treasures.

Anyone may apply to volunteer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by completing a [volunteer services agreement](/pdf/form/volunteer-agreement.pdf). Volunteers must be at least 16 years old; however, for some tasks, 12 – 15 year olds can be permitted to volunteer if accompanied by a trained parent or guardian. Anyone under the age of 18 must have parental approval. Organized group participation is welcomed and encouraged.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also has a working relationship with the [Student Conservation Association](https://www.thesca.org/), which is a nationwide force of high school and college-age volunteers who are committed to protecting and preserving the environment.
