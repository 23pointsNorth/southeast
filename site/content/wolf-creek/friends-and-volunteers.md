## Volunteer

A visit to the hatchery may inspire you to learn more about volunteering with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Volunteer at the visitor center or help with fish production, one day per week, month, or become a full-time work camper.

For those living on one of the campsites, hours are estimated at 20 to 24 per person, per week.  For all others, any and all time is greatly appreciated!  In exchange for service, volunteers receive a free campsite with water, electric and sewer hookup along with wireless internet access and laundry facilities. Propane hookup available during the winter months.
