Come face to face with the region’s underwater friends, explore karst terrain, see the inner workings of an active honey bee hive, and meet Dale, the lifelike animatronic fish biologist—all by stepping into the unique and exciting exhibit hall at the Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery Visitor/Environmental Education Center.

Much more awaits the entire family in a fun and engaging educational journey through the center—located on a working trout hatchery at the base of Wolf Creek Dam and beautiful Lake Cumberland. Visitors are welcome to tour the hatchery and fish the well-stocked creek below the hatchery. A theater, gift shop, picnic areas, wheelchair accessible fishing ramp, special events, and nearby camping and lodging make Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery a destination not to be missed.

Don't forget to check out our gift shop operated by the Friends of Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery, Inc. The shop offers a wide array of books, pins, fishing bait and light tackle, home decor and more - all designed with an outdoor/environmental education theme in mind. All proceeds from sales in the shop are used to help support the hatchery, its mission and environmental education and outreach needs. Take time to learn more about the hatchery; we offer a scavenger hunt for younger kids and a new adventure called Questing! Inquire at the front desk for more information.

## Hatchery Creek

In 2016, the Service completed an extensive rehabilitation and extension of Hatchery Creek. The creek provides pristine habitat for trout spawning and rearing and features riffles, pools, and runs, as well as a series of step pools for fish to enter from the Cumberland River. It extends over one mile, meandering through various habitats, and providing water/food sources for native wildlife.
