Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery was constructed in 1975 making it one of the most recently constructed hatcheries in the federal hatchery system. With an annual budget of $985,000, this station produces approximately 1,000,000 rainbow, brown, and brook trout weighing 275,000 pounds annually. In cooperation with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, fish are stocked into 120 different public fishing waters in the state. No private waters are stocked. The majority of the fish are stocked in waters managed by the federal government.
