What do you do when you realize that you face a problem too big to tackle alone? What did Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern and Flash do when they faced their first super villain, [Starro the Conqueror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starro)?

They formed the Justice League.

**Today we face environmental challenges so great, no single organization can handle them alone.**

Problems like drought, sea level rise, ocean acidification, melting snowcaps and groundwater pollution are large-scale and complex, spreading across cities, states, rivers, mountains and oceans.

## Alliances in Science

**Landscape Conservation Cooperatives** (LCCs) are scientific partnerships designed to assess and help tackle the biggest conservation challenges of the 21st century.

In order to ensure the sustainability of our economy, land, water, wildlife and cultural resources, LCCs gather together experts from universities, businesses, nonprofits, local, state and federal governments in similar geographic areas.

LCCs provide scientific and technical support for conservation at “landscape” scales, covering the entire range of an identified priority species or groups of species. They also have a role in helping partners identify common goals and priorities to target the right science in the right places for efficient and effective conservation. By functioning as network of interdependent units rather than independent entities, LCC partnerships can accomplish a conservation mission no single agency or organization can accomplish alone.

LCCs are:
- Science-driven
- Collaborative
- Adaptive
- Voluntary
- Open forums

In the face of accelerated [climate change](/our-changing-climate) and other 21st-century conservation challenges, LCCs will regularly evaluate the effectiveness of scientific information and conservation actions and support necessary adjustments as new information becomes available. This iterative process of information sharing will help scientists and resource managers deal with uncertainties on the landscape and provide tools to compare and contrast the implications of management alternatives.

## Get Started with Southeastern LCCs
