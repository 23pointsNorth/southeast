Data management refers to the collection, storage, retrieval, and analysis of information throughout an organization's entire lifecycle. Data management practices and procedures empower leaders to make timely, informed decisions to further conservation.

A [2013 Executive Order](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) made open and machine readable the new default for government information. Machine readable data formats makes it easier for data management systems across government to communicate and share data more effectively.
