Nationally, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is led by a Director, a team of Assistant Directors and eight Regional Directors. (See our [headquarters organizational chart.](http://www.fws.gov/offices/orgcht.html))

The conservation actions of the Southeast Region are guided by the Southeast Regional Director, Deputy Regional Director, and a team of Assistant Regional Directors and Chiefs who guide regional operations.

## Leopoldo "Leo" Miranda

### Regional Director

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/leo-miranda-bio.jpg" alt="Portrait shot of a man wearing a burgandy USFWS shirt in a longleaf pine stand." >}}

As the Southeast Regional Director of the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Leopoldo “Leo” Miranda administers the federal government’s role in conserving the Region’s fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats for the benefit of the American people. Leo oversees the work of approximately 1,300 employees, who carry out the Service’s regional mission at National Wildlife Refuges, Ecological Services Field Offices, National Fish Hatcheries, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Offices, a Fish Health Lab, and a Fish Technology Center; and through programs for Gulf Restoration, Science Applications, Migratory Birds, Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration, Law Enforcement, Budget and Administration, and External Affairs. The Southeast Region is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and operates within 10 southeastern states (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas), Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

A native of Ciales, Puerto Rico, Leo champions the sustaining of the nation’s biodiversity through partnership efforts between the public and private sectors. From his first position as a Service Private Lands biologist whose research and advocacy helped pioneer the shade-grown coffee industry in Puerto Rico, Leo has been committed to working for and with people across all boundaries to achieve win-win solutions that allow people and wildlife resources to thrive.

Prior to assuming his current role, Leo was the Assistant Regional Director of the Southeast Region’s Ecological Services Program. His responsibilities included the administration of the Endangered Species Act, a comprehensive law aimed at conserving and restoring federally designated endangered and threatened species and the habitats they depend upon. He led the Region’s highly successful At-Risk Species wildlife strategy, which focuses on using the tools available under the Endangered Species Act to prevent the need to list species. As a private landowner himself, Leo appreciates both the law’s flexibility and its conservation potential. He and his family own a farm near Columbus, Georgia, where they harvest and sell timber while managing their land for at-risk and endangered species, including gopher tortoises and red-cockaded woodpeckers.

Before joining the Southeast Region, Leo was the Program Supervisor for the Service’s Chesapeake Bay Field Office in Annapolis, Maryland. There, he honed his skills in achieving large-scale conservation outcomes through collaboration. He led a team responsible for protecting endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, freshwater and anadromous fish, and wildlife habitats in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. Leo and his team worked tirelessly with public and private partners to preserve and protect living resources of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.

Leo holds a Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology from the University of Puerto Rico and a Master of Science in Zoology from North Carolina State University. He and his wife, Jessica, son, Pablo, and the four-legged members of their family live in Marietta, GA. He and Pablo are avid hunters and anglers, and he attributes much of their mutual love of nature and their commitment to conservation to the pursuit of these pastimes.

David Viker is a 26-year veteran of the Service, starting his career in 1992 as a wildlife biologist trainee after serving as a refuge volunteer while in college at the University of Florida. David worked up refuge management ranks on five field stations in five states. Along the way, he earned a federal law enforcement commission, obtained a fire management wildfire “red card,” and operated an array of heavy equipment pieces to manage habitat. David moved on to the Atlanta Regional Office as a Deputy Refuge Supervisor, helping leading several dozen refuges in four states. David then stepped up as Regional Chief and then Assistant Regional Director of the Migratory Bird Program, working closely with States and other partners in the Joint Ventures System and system of Flyways to set migratory bird regulations. David returned to the NWRS after more than five years with Migratory Bird Program.

Since January 2011, David served as the Regional Chief of the NWRS in the Southeast Region, leading more than 650 permanent employees on 130 refuges in 10 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These refuges, visited by more than 15 million people annually, range from just a few acres for an endangered species to the 400,000-acre Okefenokee wilderness.

David’s areas of greatest professional interest include compatibility and appropriate use policy, connecting wildlife habitats through landscape linkages, and connecting people with nature. David’s greatest passion, though, is helping others grow. He has served over the years as the regional youth coordinator; member of the Diversity Committee; he founded the regional Leadership Development Council; helped establish the “E-4 Mentoring” program; teaches at the National Conservation Training Center (Refuge Academy; Advanced Refuge Academy; and the NWRS Improvement Act course he helped design); speaks frequently on the power of diversity; and has helped coach the Advanced Leadership Development Program.

David’s favorite quote is by Thomas Jefferson: “In matters of style, swim with the current. In matters of principle, stand like a rock.” David has been a volunteer youth sports coach for more than 40 teams, ages 4 to 18, in basketball, baseball, softball, track &amp; field, and soccer. His favorite times are spent with his wife of 23 years and their three children, doing faith-based volunteering, fishing, canoeing, hiking, camping, hunting, and other outdoor-activities.
