Since January 2011 David has served as the Regional Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System in the Southeast Region. David currently leads nearly 700 permanent employees in the management of 130 NWRs in 10 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These Refuges range from just a few acres for an endangered species to the 400,000-acre Okefenokee wilderness, and are visited by 15 million people, the largest regional program in the nation.

David is a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, starting his career in 1992 as a wildlife biologist Co-Op Student (now called [Pathways](/work-with-us/internships#pathways-internship-program)) at the Jackson, Mississippi joint National Wildlife Refuge System and Migratory Bird Program field office.  His first exposure to the Service was as a volunteer on [Lower Suwannee](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/lower_suwannee/) and [Cedar Keys](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/cedar_keys/) National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) in 1990 while in college at the University of Florida.

David has worked as an assistant refuge manager trainee at
[Tensas River NWR](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/tensas_river/) in north Louisiana, and as an assistant refuge manager for the Central Louisiana NWR Complex down in Cajun country, where he obtained a federal wildlife law enforcement officer commission. He worked at Pee Dee NWR as an assistant manager in North Carolina, and he spent time in Mississippi as the Refuge Manager for Hillside, Morgan Break, and Matthews Brake NWRs where he began gravitating towards all-things coaching, mentoring, and leadership development. David’s final field station was as the Deputy Project Leader for the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee and Hobe Sound NWRs in south Florida.

David worked in the Regional Office next as a Deputy Refuge Supervisor, helping lead several dozen National Wildlife Refuges in five states.  Fifteen years after starting his FWS career at a Migratory Bird-focused field station, he stepped up as Regional Chief of the Migratory Bird Program, working closely with states and other partners in the Joint Ventures System, the development of Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, and migratory bird regulations setting in the Flyway system.  David returned to the National Wildlife Refuge System  after more than five years with the Migratory Bird Program.

His areas of greatest professional interest include compatibility and appropriate use policy, connecting wildlife habitats through landscape linkages, and connecting people with nature.  David’s greatest passion, though, is helping others grow.  

David has served as a volunteer youth sports coach for 38 teams, ages 4 to 18, dating back to 1989 in basketball, baseball, softball, and soccer.  His very best times, though, are spent with his best friend and wife of 21 years and their three children doing faith-based volunteering, fishing, canoeing, hiking, camping, hunting, and other outdoor-activities.
