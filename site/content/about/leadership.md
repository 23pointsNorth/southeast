## David Viker, Regional Chief, National Wildlife Refuge System

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/david-viker.jpg" alt="Portrait shot of a man wearing a blue U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service polo shirt." caption="David Viker. Photo by USFWS." >}}

David Viker is a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, starting his career in 1992 as a wildlife biologist Co-Op Student (now called [Pathways](/work-with-us/internships#pathways-internship-program)) at the Jackson, Mississippi joint National Wildlife Refuge System and Migratory Bird Program field office.  David’s first exposure to the Service was as a volunteer on [Lower Suwannee](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/lower_suwannee/) and [Cedar Keys](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/cedar_keys/) NWRs in 1990 while in college at the University of Florida.

David second assignment with the Service was as an assistant refuge manager trainee at [Tensas River NWR](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/tensas_river/) in north Louisiana, his first of several field stations where he was very involved in waterfowl management and forestry.  His next stop was as assistant refuge manager for the Central Louisiana NWR Complex down in Cajun country, where he obtained a federal wildlife law enforcement officer commission.  David then worked at Pee NWR as an assistant manager in North Carolina and served on a long-term detail as the acting refuge manager of the Carolina Sandhills NWR in South Carolina.  In the Carolinas David obtained a fire management red card and was involved in a numerous prescribed burns.  David’s fourth field station was in Mississippi as the Refuge Manager for Hillside, Morgan Break, and Matthews Brake where he began gravitating towards all-things coaching, mentoring, and leadership development.  His final field station was as the Deputy Project Leader for the Arthur R. Marshal Loxahatchee and Hobe Sound NWRs in south Florida.  There he supervised the largest refuge field staff in the Region, led development of a comprehensive conservation plan, helped renegotiate the refuge’s license agreement, managed invasive exotic species, and expanded refuge support (Friends) groups.

David worked in the Regional Office next as a Deputy Refuge Supervisor, helping leading several dozen NWRs in five states.  Fifteen years after starting his FWS career at a Migratory Bird-focused field station, David then stepped up as Regional Chief of the Migratory Bird Program, working closely with States and other partners in the Joint Ventures System, the development of Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, and migratory bird regulations setting in the Flyway system.  David returned to the NWRS after more than five years with Migratory Bird Program.

Since January 2011 David served as the Regional Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System in the Southeast Region.  David currently leads nearly 700 permanent employees in the management of 130 NWRs in 10 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These Refuges range from just a few acres for an endangered species to the 400,000-acre Okefenokee wilderness, and are visited by 15 million people, the largest regional program in the nation.

David’s areas of greatest professional interest include compatibility and appropriate use policy, connecting wildlife habitats through landscape linkages, and connecting people with nature.  David’s greatest passion, though, is helping others grow.  He has served over the years as the regional SCEP (now Pathways) coordinator; member of the Diversity Committee; he founded the R4-NWRS Leadership Development Council; helped establish the “E-4 Mentoring” program; teaches at the National Conservation Training Center (Refuge Academy, Advanced Refuge Academy, and NWRS Improvement Act courses); speaks frequently on the power of diversity; and currently serves as a coach for the Advanced Leadership Development Program.  

David’s favorite quote is by Thomas Jefferson:  “In matters of style, swim with the current.  In matters of principle, stand like a rock.”  David has served as a volunteer youth sports coach for 38 teams, ages 4 to 18, dating back to 1989 in basketball, baseball, softball, and soccer.  His very best times, though, are spent with his best friend and wife of 21 years and their three children doing faith-based volunteering, fishing, canoeing, hiking, camping, hunting, and other outdoor-activities.
