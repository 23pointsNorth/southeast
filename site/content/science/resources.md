There are many places where scientific information that is useful for natural resources conservation is stored. See here for links, descriptions and how science information is being used to address Service needs.

## Scientific Information Databases

### [Environmental Conservation Online System Science (ECOS)](http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/)

Produces a variety of reports related to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species. Some popular reports include:

 - [All Threatened and Endangered Animals](http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/ad-hoc-species-report?kingdom=V&kingdom=I&status=E&status=T&status=EmE&status=EmT&status=EXPE&status=EXPN&status=SAE&status=SAT&fcrithab=on&fstatus=on&fspecrule=on&finvpop=on&fgroup=on&header=Listed+Animals)
 - [All Threatened and Endangered Plants](http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/ad-hoc-species-report?kingdom=P&status=E&status=T&status=EmE&status=EmT&status=EXPE&status=EXPN&status=SAE&status=SAT&fcrithab=on&fstatus=on&fspecrule=on&finvpop=on&fgroup=on&ffamily=on&header=Listed+Plants)
 - [Critical Habitat Report](http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/table/critical-habitat.html)
 - [Delisted Species](http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/delisting-report)
 - [Listed Species Summary](http://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/box-score-report)
 - [Reclassified Species](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/reclassified-species-report)

### [USGS ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/)

ScienceBase is an open source project that provides a collaborative scientific database. Key elements include:

  - Data cataloging and collaborative data management platform,
  - Central search and discovery application,
  - Web services facilitating other applications, and
  - Research community catalogs.

### [The Fish & Wildlife Service Catalog (ServCat)](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/)

ServCat is a centralized data management system designed to archive, manage and deliver Fish & Wildlife Service information. Some of the document include:
  - [Inventory and Monitoring Plans (IMP)](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Search/Advanced/199): These plans document resource needs and challenges, and can easily be revised to address shifts in priorities due to environmental change.
  - [Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plans (CCP)](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Search/Advanced/17): Long-term planning document that ensures each refuge is managed to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was established.
  - [Refuge Annual Narrative Reports](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Search/Advanced/248): Outlines refuge accomplishments over a specific time period.
  - [Land Status Maps](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Search/Advanced/129): Maps that depict land ownership within refuges and hatcheries.
  - [Geospatial Datasets](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Search/Advanced/291): National-level geospatial datasets documented in ServCat.
  - [Refuge Hydrogeomorphic Analysis Reports](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Search/Advanced/371): Provides an evaluation of ecosystem restoration and management options for a refuge.

## Project Planning Tools

### [Information for Planning and Conservation (IPaC)](https://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/)

This is an early planning tool that provides the location and potential effect of projects on species and other trust resources under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
  - Initial Project Scoping  - Assist in identifying threatened or endangered species, critical habitat, migratory birds or other natural resources may be impacted by a project.
  - Resource Maps - Explore the distribution of important biological resources, such as wetlands, National Wildlife Refuges, critical habitat, GAP land cover and more.
  - Impact Analysis - Provide information about your project and receive a list of conservation measures suggested by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. This information can be used if you need to start a formal consultation.

### [Geospatial Fisheries Information Network (GeoFIN)](http://ecos.fws.gov/geofin/)

The GeoFIN mapper is an interactive mapping tool that allows you to view barriers to fish passage across the U.S. as well as model their removal in your watershed. It also generates profiles and reports for a given geographic area and can search the USFWS fish passage barrier database.

### [National Wind Coordinating Collaborative (NWCC)](https://www.nationalwind.org/)

Formed to address sustainable development of wind power that comprises a diverse set of stakeholders. NWCC’s work is currently focused on wind and wildlife issues.  The American Wind Wildlife Institute hosts regular NWCC webinars on the latest research and tools related to the interactions of wind energy, wildlife, and wildlife habitat: https://www.nationalwind.org/research/webinars/.

### [Tracking and Reporting on Actions for Conservation of Species (TRACS)](https://tracs.fws.gov/public/)

Wildlife TRACS is the tracking and reporting system for conservation and related actions funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program. There are three ways to search the actions funded: Dashboard, Project Map, or Search by State.

## Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Data

### [National GIS Data Layers](https://www.fws.gov/gis/data/national/)

This site provides a collection of National GIS data layers and associated metadata.  Many of the layers available on this site are used in various web mapping portals across the Service including the [Critical Habitat Mapper](http://fws.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=9d8de5e265ad4fe09893cf75b8dbfb77), the [Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) Mapper](https://www.fws.gov/ecological-services/habitat-conservation/cbra/maps/mapper.html), and the [National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Mapper](https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Mapper.html).

### Conservation Planning Atlases

The Conservation Planning Atlas (CPA) is a science-based mapping platform where conservation managers and LCC members can go to view, retrieve, and perform analyses on spatial information with specific conservation goals in mind. Eight portals have been created for the LCC network:

 - [Appalachian LCC](http://www.conservationdesign.org/)
 - [Caribbean LCC](https://caribbeanlcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Gulf Coast Prairie LCC (GCP LCC)](https://gcplcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks LCC (GCPO LCC)](https://gcpolcc.databasin.org/)
 - [North Atlantic LCC (NA LCC)](https://nalcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Peninsular Florida LCC (PA LCC)](https://pflcc.databasin.org/)
 - [South Atlantic LCC (SA LCC)](http://salcc.databasin.org/)
 - [Southeastern United States](http://seregion.databasin.org/)

Data from Landscape Conservation Cooperatives across the Southeast have been integrated into the [Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS) Blueprint 1.0](http://secassoutheast.org/blueprint).

## For U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Employees

### [Fisheries Information Systems (FIS)](https://ecos.fws.gov/fis/sec/)

The Fisheries Information System (FIS) is an online database for the collection and management of Fish and Aquatic Conservation (FAC) Program information, focused on tracking program accomplishments and operational needs for performance reporting and strategic planning. FIS also tracks progress towards implementing restoration and recovery tasks in the context of planning documents and the status of populations in the wild. FIS is the primary tool for reporting performance measure information and allows data to be entered at the field office, reviewed by the Regional Office (RO), and compiled in the Washington Office (WO) for budget and management purposes.

### [Tracking And Integrated Logging System (TAILS)](https://ecos.fws.gov/josso2/signon/login.do?josso_back_to=https://ecos.fws.gov/fis/josso_security_check&josso_partnerapp_id=fis)

TAILS is a secure, internet-based ecological service activity tracking system. It is designed to promote and provide consistent recording and reporting of "Activities". TAILS is part of the FWS Environmental Conservation Online System (ECOS). Modules for tracking include:

  - Section 7 consultations
  - Federal activities
  - Contaminant activities

### [Literature Search Service](https://inside.fws.gov/index.cfm/go/post/NCTC-FWS-LSS-Literature-Search-Service)

Accessible to USFWS employees only. Provides biologists and project leaders access to over 2,000 peer-reviewed, scientific, technical and social science journals in electronic format to meet our good science goals.
