Employees within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service use science on a daily basis as the foundation for carrying out our mission.

For more information on our mission and activities see our [FY2018 update](/pdf/regional-science-committee-fy2018-update.pdf).

Science-based natural resource conservation requires that our employees have timely access to:

- Scientific research, information, and state-of-the-art scientific tools
- Peer interaction among scientific colleagues
- Science-based conservation strategies for habitat and population management
- Training and mentoring opportunities in:
- Understanding, analyzing, applying, and communicating complex scientific concepts, information, and tools
- Awareness of the appropriate practices and procedures to use when engaging in science activities, such as conducting research, seeking peer review, and using, publishing, and distributing scientific information

## Regional science committee

[The Southeast Region Science Committee](/science/committee) plays a role in improving communication about science within the Service.  The committee has individuals with expertise in a broad range of topics including threatened and endangered species, landscape scale conservation and renewable energy.

## Science-based projects

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff uses science on a day to day basis to inform conservation decisions that range from onsite management practices to listing of endangered species.  The science that we use comes from our staff and work done by others such as projects conducted via the [Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Units](https://www.fws.gov/science/cesu.html) (CESU) and projects developed in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey via the [Science Support Partnership Program](/science/science-support-partnership/projects) (SSP).

### Supporting science through the Southeast Region I&amp;M request for proposals

Since the inception of the Southeast Region I&amp;M Branch in 2011, there has been a strong effort to provide direct funding in support of inventory and monitoring needs on refuges. Since 2011 annual solicitation proposal request theme has evolved from open-ended topics in the first few years to more recently targeted themes such as at-risk species in 2016 and basic inventory of biotic and abiotic natural resources in 2017. Examples of local refuge projects include basic taxa inventories of plants and animals, long-term monitoring of water quality, and bird nesting and migration, to larger regional and national efforts associated with bat population monitoring and changes in coastal wetland systems associated with sea-level rise and climate change. All refuge projects share the goal of providing a stronger basis of science for local, regional, and national decisions. 

Recently, the I&amp;M Branch [has been archiving the project proposals, reports and data sets into the Service Catalog to provide a centralized location for reference](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/66785).

## Landscape Conservation Design

This is a [practitionerâ€™s guide to landscape conservation design](https://www.fws.gov/science/LCD-guide.html) (LCD). LCD is a partner-driven approach to achieve a sustainable, resilient landscape that meets the ecological and social needs of current and future generations. It is an iterative, collaborative, and holistic process resulting in spatially explicit products and adaptation strategies that provide information, analytical tools, maps, and strategies to achieve landscape goals collectively held among partners (LCC Network 2016a). As public-private partnerships for collaborating on landscape-scale conservation issues, the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC) have had years of experience with LCD. Staff from across the LCC Network assembled these recommended practices to provide practical guidance for anyone looking to facilitate or participate in an LCD process (design process).

This guide contains five sections covering major themes in LCD. Each section describes vetted practices one or more LCCs have used in their LCD work, provides resources for further information, and presents a real-world example where the practices have been implemented. The practices are arranged in a logical order but they are not necessarily chronological. Successful LCD requires participants to revisit and refine their work; therefore, embracing iteration is an overarching theme of the process.
