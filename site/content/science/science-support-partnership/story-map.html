  <p>Through the Science Support Partnership (SSP) Program, the Fish and Wildlife Service partners with U.S. Geological Survey to understand and provide the critical science information required to effectively manage our nation’s resources.  Since 2001 over 60 projects have been completed that support science needs in the Southeast Region.</p>

  <h3>How to Use this Map</h3>
  <p>Click on a project marker to learn more.  If you're accessing this map on a computer you can hold the shift key while you click and drag your mouse to zoom in on a specific area. You can also double click to zoom in, or use the zoom controls in the top left corner.</p>

  <p>To download data use the polygon tool on the left side of the map below the zoom-in/zoom-out buttons to draw a shape.  Your polygon should include all of the projects that you would like to download data from.  Complete a polygon by clicking on the starting vertex, or the finish button connected to the polygon button.  If you have drawn a polygon that includes one or more projects a "Download Projects" button will appear below the map, which when clicked will download the data as a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file.  You can open a CSV with any spreadsheet software.</p>
