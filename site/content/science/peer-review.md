The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has always consulted experts to ensure that our decisions are based on sound science, through this peer review process we follow the guidelines for Federal agencies spelled out in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) *[Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2005-01-14/pdf/05-769.pdf)* released December 16, 2004.

Part of the peer review process is to provide information on the Web about how each peer review is to be conducted, as described in [this checklist](https://www.fws.gov/informationquality/peer_review/).
