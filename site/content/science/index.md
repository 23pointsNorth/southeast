Employees within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service use science on a daily basis as the foundation for carrying out our mission.

Science-based natural resource conservation requires that our employees have timely access to:
  - Scientific research, information, and state-of-the-art scientific tools
  - Peer interaction among scientific colleagues
  - Science-based conservation strategies for habitat and population management
  - Training and mentoring opportunities in:
  - Understanding, analyzing, applying, and communicating complex scientific concepts, information, and tools
  - Awareness of the appropriate practices and procedures to use when engaging in science activities, such as conducting research, seeking peer review, and using, publishing, and distributing scientific information

## Science-based Projects
Through the Science Support Partnership (SSP) Program, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service partners with U.S. Geological Survey to understand and provide the critical science information required to effectively manage our nationâ€™s resources.  Since 2001 over 60 projects have been completed that support science needs in the Southeast Region.
