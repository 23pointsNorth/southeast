Employees within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service use science on a daily basis as the foundation for carrying out our mission.

Science-based natural resource conservation requires that our employees have timely access to:

  - Scientific research, information, and state-of-the-art scientific tools
  - Peer interaction among scientific colleagues
  - Science-based conservation strategies for habitat and population management
  - Training and mentoring opportunities in:
  - Understanding, analyzing, applying, and communicating complex scientific concepts, information, and tools
  - Awareness of the appropriate practices and procedures to use when engaging in science activities, such as conducting research, seeking peer review, and using, publishing, and distributing scientific information

## Regional Science Committee

[The Southeast Region Science Committee](/science/committee) plays a role in improving communication about science within the Service.  The committee has individuals with expertise in a broad range of topics including threatened and endangered species, landscape scale conservation and renewable energy.

## Science-based Projects

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff uses science on a day to day basis to inform conservation decisions that range from onsite management practices to listing of endangered species.  The science that we use comes from our staff and work done by others such as projects conducted via the [Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Units](https://www.fws.gov/science/cesu.html) (CESU) and projects developed in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey via the [Science Support Partnership Program](/science/science-support-partnership/projects) (SSP).
