An estuary is a coastal body of water connecting rivers or streams to the open sea. Estuaries are a transition between river environments and maritime environments.

## Eastern oyster

The eastern oyster was once plentiful throughout the south Atlantic coast. Since the arrival of humans, oysters have been exploited for subsistence and commercial purposes. Over many years of harvest, shell was rarely returned to the estuaries. Since oyster shell promotes oyster reef growth, this practice resulted in substantial declines in oyster populations. As a result, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has implemented a program to return shell to the environment in an effort to rebuild oyster populations.

Bears Bluff National Fish Hatchery, in partnership with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), is now a public drop-off site for oyster shell. Oyster shell collected at Bears Bluff will be packaged in mesh bags and returned to estuaries as reefs. By returning this material to its natural environment, we are increasing suitable substrate for larval oysters while improving habitat for fish and other coastal aquatic species. By donating your shell, you become an important partner in the effort to conserve our coastal resources.

The oyster reef shown below was built with recycled oyster shell at Bears Bluff through a partnership with SCDNR, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and local citizens.. An established oyster reef helps improve water quality, increases biodiversity, and reduces erosion. These efforts help maintain South Carolina’s oyster populations which in turn provide habitat for estuarine dependent fish and wildlife.

Estuarine fish such as red drum  are produced in ponds at Bears Bluff. Upon release, fingerlings search for areas where they can find refuge from predators. Because oyster reefs are three dimensional, they not only provide excellent protection from predators but also increase habitat for other organisms that may serve as food for the fingerlings. For this reason, red drum produced at Bears Bluff are often stocked near submerged oyster beds.

## Did You Know?

- A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day.
- Oyster reefs provide essential habitat for fish, shrimp, crabs, birds and other estuarine dependent wildlife.
- Oyster reefs serve as natural breakwaters that reduce erosion.
- Oyster populations along the east coast appear to be declining due to excessive harvest, reduced suitable substrate, pollution, and disease.

## Saltmarsh cordgrass

Saltmarsh cordgrass or sometimes called smooth cordgrass (*Sporobolus alternifolius*) is a dominant grass in South Carolina’s salt marsh and can be found all along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. It is the only grass with the adaptations necessary to survive in the salt marsh. Due to its extensive root system and dense growth habit, this plant is ideal for trapping and holding sediment and reversing the effects of erosion. When planted alongside oyster reefs, barren or damaged habitat can be quickly transformed into a “living shoreline”.

Bears Bluff National Fish Hatchery has partnered with South Carolina Sea Grant, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, local schools, and other organizations interested in increasing aquatic habitats along South Carolina’s estuarine coast. This partnership called Seeds to Shoreline, has led to the cultivation of *Sporobolus alternifolius* from wild-collected seeds.

Seeds are collected in the fall and placed into wet, cold storage for a few months. Once removed from cold storage the seeds break dormancy and germinate. The seeds are planted and allowed to grow for several months in green houses at Bears Bluff National Fish Hatchery. When the plants are ready, the tides are right, and volunteers and students are ready, the plants are transplanted into the intertidal zone in an effort to increase salt marsh habitat. Planting generally occurs nears oyster reef projects conducted at Bears Bluff and other off site oyster reef project locations.
