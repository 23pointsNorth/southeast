Bears Bluff National Fish Hatchery consists of 31 acres bordering the North Edisto River south of Charleston, South Carolina. The hatchery's primary area of concern is the south Atlantic coast. The hatchery has flexible and unique capabilities available to propagate and study most freshwater and saltwater aquatic species found in the South Atlantic Coastal Region. Facilities include nine recirculated intensive culture systems; three recirculated egg incubation/larval rearing systems; numerous holding and intensive rearing tanks; and six salt and freshwater ponds.

## Goals
