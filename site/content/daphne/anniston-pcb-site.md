The historic releases of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) production wastes from the Monsanto Companyâ€™s Anniston facility resulted in the contamination of fish and wildlife habitats in and around Calhoun, Talladega, Shelby, Chilton, Elmore, and Coosa counties.

## PCB clean-up activities

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) Southeast Region is working with the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state natural resource agencies, and Solutia, Inc., (Solutia; a subsidiary of Eastman Chemical Company) and Pharmacia Corporation (Pharmacia, formerly known as Monsanto Company) to perform a comprehensive study and evaluation of risks to human health and the environment caused by PCBs.

## NRDAR process overview

The Natural Resources Damage Assessment and Restoration (NRDAR) process is used by the natural resource trustees to determine the amount of restoration needed to restore the habitats and resources back to the condition they would have been in if the contaminants had not been released, and to compensate the public for the loss of their use and enjoyment of their natural resources.

The Trustee agencies for this NRDAR are the Department of the Interior, as represented by the Regional Director of the Southeast Region of the Service, the [Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources](http://www.dcnr.state.al.us/), and the [Geological Survey of Alabama](http://www.gsa.state.al.us/).
