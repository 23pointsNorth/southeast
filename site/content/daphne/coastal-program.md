The Northern Gulf Coastal Program (NGCP) is a voluntary, partnership-based U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service program that delivers technical and financial assistance for habitat conservation in coastal watersheds and marine ecosystems. We develop tools and resources designed to help managers, practitioners, and communities to carry out habitat conservation actions. We improve and protect habitat on both public and private lands, which is important in coastal areas.  The NGCP is a branch of the Alabama Ecological Services Field Office.

## Goals

- To effectively restore or enhance degraded coastal wetlands and uplands, estuaries, and riverbank corridors along the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, and within the context of climate change and sea level rise;
- To establish living shorelines as the primary means for protecting eroding shorelines in these coastal areas where appropriate, thereby steering coastal protection efforts away from hardening;
- To form partnerships with private groups and government agencies to strategically restore, enhance, conserve, and protect coastal habitat and resources;
- To implement the Strategic Habitat Conservation framework to put the right conservation in the right places across the coastal landscape for the benefit of fish and wildlife.

## Focus areas

The majority of available funds will support projects that occur in the following watersheds: Perdido River, Mobile River, Pascagoula Basin, Mississippi Coastal, Pearl-Bogue Chitto, North Lake Pontchartrain.  Relevant projects located in adjacent watersheds may also be considered, including the entire Louisiana coast. The project area covers an area of almost 10 million acres, including 21 counties or parishes.

### Mississippi Coastal

The Mississippi Coast Focus Area includes Mississippi Sound and adjacent coastal habitats and barrier islands as well as portions of Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, Lamar, Pearl River, and Stone counties in Mississippi and Mobile County in Alabama. There are 1,561,405 acres in this focus area. Coastal rivers that feed this area include Jourdan, Wolf, Biloxi, Tchoutacabouffa, Bayou La Batre, and Fowl Rivers. Habitat restoration in this focus area could promote ringed map turtles, yellow blotched map turtles, gopher tortoises, black pine snakes, Eastern indigo snakes, red-cockaded woodpeckers, Mississippi gopher frogs, Alabama red- bellied turtles, manatees, migratory birds (shorebirds, wading birds, waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, etc.), Mississippi sandhill cranes, sea turtles, saltmarsh topminnows, and Gulf sturgeon.

### Mobile River Basin

The Mobile River Basin is the sixth largest watershed in the United States, with the fourth largest freshwater inflow, receiving drainage from almost two-thirds of Alabama and portions of Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Sitting at the southern end is the 3,113,580 acre Mobile Basin Focus Area. Portions of counties that are included in this focus area are Baldwin, Choctaw, Clarke, Escambia, Mobile, Monroe, Washington, and Wilcox. Within the focus area the Tombigbee and Alabama Rivers combine to form the Mobile River that empties into Mobile Bay. Several smaller coastal rivers also flow into the bay. Species that may benefit from habitat restoration in this area are Alabama beach mice, red-cockaded woodpeckers, gopher tortoises, black pine snakes, Eastern indigo snakes, Alabama red-bellied turtles, manatees, migratory birds (shorebirds, wading birds, waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, etc.) and anadromous fish (Gulf sturgeon, Alabama shad, and striped bass), as well as, submerged aquatic vegetation and oysters.

### North Lake Ponchartrain

The North Lake Pontchartrain Focus Area contains the Tangipahoa and Liberty Bayou-Tchefuncta watersheds. Consisting of most of Tammany and Tangipahoa parishes, and small portions of St. Helena and Washington parishes in Louisiana, and Amite and Pike counties in Mississippi, this focus area covers 947,190 acres. Restoration in this area may aid Louisiana black bears, ringed map turtles, migratory birds, gopher tortoises, red-cockaded woodpeckers, manatees, and Gulf sturgeon.

### Pascagoula Basin

The Red, Black, Pascagoula and Escatawpa Rivers make up the 1,865,711 acre Pascagoula Basin Focus Area. This  area is located almost completely in southeast Mississippi, with some of Alabama’s Mobile and Washington counties included. Portions of the counties of Forrest, George, Greene, Jackson, Jefferson Davis, Lamar, Marion, Pearl River, Perry, and Stone in Mississippi make up this focus area. Species that may be helped by restoration in this area are yellow blotched map turtles, gopher tortoises, black pine snakes, Eastern indigo snakes, Mississippi gopher frogs, Alabama red-bellied turtles, red-cockaded woodpeckers, manatees, migratory birds, Mississippi sandhill cranes, Pearl darters, and Gulf sturgeon.

### Pearl-Bogue Chitto

Overlapping into Mississippi and Louisiana is the Pearl-Bogue Chitto Focus Area. Comprised of the Lower Pearl River and the Bogue Chitto, this focus area covers 1,916,807 acres. Hancock, Lamar, Lincoln, Marion, Pearl River, Pike, and Walthall counties in Mississippi and St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington parishes in Louisiana are included in this focus area. Species that may benefit from the Program’s efforts in this area include Louisiana black bears, ringed map turtles, Pearl darters, gopher tortoises, black pine snakes, manatees, migratory birds, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and Gulf sturgeon.

### Perdido River

The Perdido Bay Focus Area encompasses approximately 772,486 acres in eastern Baldwin County, and a small portion of western Escambia County, Alabama, and western Santa Rosa County, Florida. The Perdido River is the major waterway in this focus area, emptying into the Perdido Bay. Other waterbodies contained within this focus area include Wolf Bay, a portion of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and numerous smaller bays, bayous, and coves. Species that may benefit from habitat restoration in this area are Perdido Key beach mice, manatees, migratory birds (shorebirds, wading birds, waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, etc.) and anadromous fish (Gulf sturgeon, Alabama shad, and striped bass).
