As part of the National Broodstock Program, Erwin National Fish Hatchery produces rainbow trout eggs that are shipped to hatcheries nationwide to help preserve the angling tradition for present and future generations.

## Spawning operations

Each broodstock strain that is maintained at Erwin NFH has a different spawning time. A week before the fish begin to spawn they are sorted into groups of males and females. Once spawning begins the females are checked weekly to find the individuals that are ready to release their eggs that week. These fish are called “ripe” females. Each week, for the duration of the spawning period, usually 8-12 weeks, the “ripe’ females are manually stripped of their eggs and the eggs are fertilized, disinfected and transferred into an incubation jar.

Following spawning operations, freshly fertilized eggs are measured in egg jar incubators located in the hatchery building. The eggs are incubated for 14 days until they reach the “eyed” stage. They are then sorted and shipped to hatcheries and research facilities. Erwin NFH ships approximately 10 to 13 million eggs per year. A small number of eggs are hatched and reared for use as future broodstock. These fish are raised in the hatchery building tanks until they are 3-4 inches in length. They are then transferred to the outside raceways.

## Future broodstock

Future broodstock are fed and cared for in the upper production raceways after transfer from the hatchery building tanks.  Fish remain in the upper production raceways until they are one  year old. They are then moved to the lower broodstock raceways for rearing during their second year of life. They are fed a special diet formulated specifically to provide all essential nutrients necessary for gonad development.

## Adult broodstock

Adult brood fish are held in the lower broodstock raceways, and mature when they are two years old. At this age, male and female fish are separated in preparation for spawning. Female fish are checked once a week for ripeness. Eggs from ripe females are collected in pans and fertilized with milt from male fish. The freshly fertilized eggs are then taken into the hatchery building and placed in jar incubators. Following spawning, the old brood fish are distributed by truck to other hatcheries, lakes, and streams. A new year class of broodstock will take their place during the next year. The weatherports (large, white dome tents) that cover the raceways provide broodstock with protection from the sun and predacious birds.

## Water supply

The pumphouses and free flowing spring provide about 1,000 gallons of spring water per minute to the upper raceways and recirculate used water through the lower broodstock raceways. Water that passes through the lower raceways is collected and pumped back to the aeration building where oxygen is added to the reused water. The water is then recirculated through the broodstock raceways. The main water supply to the hatchery produces 1000 gallons per minute of constant 55F water. The spring has been covered with rock to prevent introduction of disease organisms.
