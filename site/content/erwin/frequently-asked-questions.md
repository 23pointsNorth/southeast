## Where can I purchase a fishing license?

The Service does not issue fishing licenses. To review Tennessee fishing regulations and to purchase a license, please contact the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency at 1-888-814-8972 or [visit them online](https://www.tn.gov/twra/license-sales/fishing-licenses.html).

## What is the Heritage Museum?

Built in 1903, this building served as the Hatchery Superintendent’s residence. In 1982, the Service entered into a cooperative agreement with Unicoi County for use of the building as a local heritage museum. The museum contains several exhibits that interpret local history.

## When is the museum open?

The Museum is open daily from  1p.m.-5 p.m., May 1 through October 31.

## Why do we need federal hatcheries and who pays for them?

Fish raised in federal hatcheries are stocked in public waters to support federal fishery responsibilities that are mandated by law. These include fish for restoration where, for example, man-made dams have altered a stream’s natural reproductive capability; or to restore threatened or endangered populations. Fish are also used to support recreational fishing programs in federal and state waters. Revenue generated from the eggs and fish produced at Erwin National Fish Hatchery generates $3 million in tax revenues and $20 million in retail sales from fishermen. Fish hatcheries are supported by tax revenue.

## How do you get the eggs from the fish?

Each week during spawning season, hatchery personnel select female rainbow trout that are ready to release their eggs. Eggs are squeezed by hand into a bowl. Water and sperm from males are added and the eggs are fertilized. The eggs are then placed into incubators.

## What do you do with the eggs?

When the eggs are tw weeks old, they are shipped to other hatcheries where they are hatched out to be reared to stocking size (approximately nine inches). When the “broodfish” are no longer needed for eggs, they are stocked in public fishing waters in Eastern Tennessee or given to the Cherokee Indian Reservation in North Carolina for their recreational fishing program.

## Do you give tours of the hatchery?

Yes, the hatchery does give guided tours to groups if arrangements are made in advance. The facilities are also open to the public for self-guided tours.
