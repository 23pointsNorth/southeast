The U.S Fish and Wildlife Service’s Raleigh Field Office conserves and manage migratory birds, with an emphasis on stemming loss of declining species in the North Carolina Piedmont, Sandhills, and Coastal Plain. Most of the North Carolina refuges were established for the conservation of migratory birds.

The office contributes to landscape-scale efforts to conserve all migratory birds, particularly for Partners in Flight Watch List species and Atlantic Coast Joint Venture Priority species that have a significant amount of their population and a portion of their life cycle in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of North Carolina.

We help private landowners in North Carolina with wetland habitat restoration, enhancement and management. This technical assistance and project cost assistance is provided through the Service’s [Partners for Fish and Wildlife program](/raleigh/partners-for-fish-and-wildlife-program). Our focus in these projects are waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, and other wetland dependant wildlife.

Our work contributes to:

1. Work toward the recovery goals set for red-cockaded woodpeckers.
2. Increase populations of at-risk migratory bird species.
3. Work with partners and private landowners to provide habitat for birds.
4. Support conservation actions identified by Partners In Flight Conservation Plan, Atlantic Coast Joint Venture Board-approved priorities, North American Waterfowl Management Plan, Waterbird Conservation for the Americas: The North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, and Southeastern Coastal Plain-Caribbean Regional Report: US Shorebird Conservation Plan.
