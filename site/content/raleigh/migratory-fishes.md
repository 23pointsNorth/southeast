The Raleigh Ecological Services Field Office in North Carolina restores populations of migratory and diadromous fish  (fish that spend their life cycles partially in fresh water and partially in salt water) and the habitats on which they depend in North Carolina.

Southeastern river systems have been dramatically modified from historic conditions through the alterations of stream flows, changes in water quality, and the construction of dams along critical migratory routes. These modifications altered aquatic biodiversity and fisheries resources of North Carolinaâ€™s rivers. In addressing these and other factors affecting migratory fishery resources, we have worked closely with our federal, state and private partners to improve habitat quality and quantity.

For example, we engaged in a 20-year leadership role in the Neuse River basin. By facilitating five dam removals, the main stem of the Neuse is now open from the ocean to Falls Lake near Raleigh. We also opened habitat in tributaries like Little River that were historically important for American shad and river herring.

Our objectives complement those identified in the [Strategic Plan for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Fish and Aquatic Conservation Program](https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/pdf_files/FAC_StrategyPlan_2016-2020.pdf) and retain our long focus on migratory fisheries in North Carolina:

- [American shad](https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/freshwater-fish-of-america/american_shad.html)
- [Hickory shad](https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/fishmigration/american_shad.html)
- [Blueback herring](https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/freshwater-fish-of-america/blueback_herring.html)
- [Alewife](https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/fishmigration/alewife.html)
- [Striped bass](https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/freshwater-fish-of-america/striped_bass.html)
- [Atlantic sturgeon](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=E0A7)
- [Shortnose sturgeon](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=6635)
- [American eel](https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/freshwater-fish-of-america/american_eel.html)

Nearly all of these fish species provide commercial and recreational economic benefits. Our goal for these species is to restore their abundance and range and improve habitat to increase carrying capacity.
