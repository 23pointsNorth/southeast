## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Summertime is upon us. Grab the sunscreen, grab the fishing pole, grab the digital camera. As part of an ongoing and widespread effort to encourage people to spend more time outside, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service invites you to submit your summer photos of friends and family enjoying the outdoors to become part of a photomosaic of nearly 10,000 images.

A photomosaic is a picture that has been divided into equal-size sections, each of which is replaced with a photograph.  When viewed at a distance, the photomosiac seems to be one complete image, while close examination reveals it as a composition of thousands of smaller images. The photomosaic will be assembled throughout the summer, with the one complete image revealed at the end of the summer and made into a poster.

To submit photos, visit www.fws.gov/letsgooutside, all one word. Visitors to the website will be able to watch the photomosaic being built and locate their own images by using a unique code number. Digital images will be accepted between Memorial and Labor Days.

The “Let’s Go Outside” initiative, supported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, encourages children, educators and parents to get outside and enjoy nature and wildlife.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
