## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Like most two-year olds, ours is busy discovering the world around her, however one thing quickly grabs her attention – butterflies. Of all the insects, perhaps none is more beloved that butterflies.

Moths and butterflies together make up the insect order *Lepidoptera*. How do you tell them apart? Butterflies generally fly during the day, while moths are active at night; and butterflies often rest with their wings folded up, and moths with their wings outstretched to the side.

Unfortunately butterflies can be a bit hard to pin down for a close look, especially for a two-year old. The Western North Carolina Nature Center has a solution.

On June 26, the nature center will open its summer butterfly exhibit for the 7th year in a row, providing one of the best chances you’ll ever have to get up close to a diversity of butterflies and moths. Enclosed by a screen, the butterfly exhibit is filled with an array of native plants that play host to hundreds of butterflies and moths. Volunteers will be on hand to answer your butterfly questions and give you a spray of sugar water in the hope of getting one of the insects to land on you. The exhibit will be up through August 24th.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
