## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

A dead bald eagle was discovered on Wednesday, May 4th at the Maggie Valley Festival Grounds located on Soco Road, US Highway 19 in Maggie Valley, North Carolina.  An examination revealed the eagle had been recently shot and bullet fragments were removed from the carcass. The eagle was immature and lacked the characteristic adult white head and tail feathers which usually come in by the 6th year.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission are investigating the Haywood County shooting. A reward of up to $2,500 is offered to anyone for information leading to a conviction of the person or persons responsible for shooting the eagle.

Though no longer on the endangered species list, bald eagles are protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, both federal wildlife statutes. Violations of these statutes carry maximum criminal penalties of up to $100,000 and/or one year in federal prison.

Anyone with information concerning this eagle is asked to call Special Agent Tom Chisdock with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement at (828) 258-2084 or Captain Greg Daniels with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission at (828) 337-9425.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
