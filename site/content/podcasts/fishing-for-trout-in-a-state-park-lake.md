## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, along with North Carolina State Parks, continue to stock trout into in Hanging Rock State Park’s lake, supporting the new Stokes County trout fishery created earlier this year.  

Stocking the 12-acre lake provides a unique opportunity in North Carolina, giving the public a chance to fish for trout outside traditional mountain trout streams. The lake was first stocked in April , and most, if not all, of those fish have been caught, which was the hope and expectation given that the trout, which like cold water with higher oxygen levels, wouldn’t survive the lake’s warmer summer temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen.

Anglers fishing the lake at Hanging Rock State Park can keep seven trout per day with no size limit or bait restrictions throughout the year. Additionally, no special trout fishing license is required, as it is in other public mountain trout waters. Anglers age 16 and older need only a basic North Carolina fishing license to catch fish in the lake, which also supports largemouth bass, bluegill and redear sunfish.

The stockings, which will occur annually in April and October, complement a new, handicapped-accessible pier built in 2013.
