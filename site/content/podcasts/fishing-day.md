## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Kid’s fishing days have been held for years across the nation. Usually falling in early June, they serve as an opportunity to expose kids, not simply to fishing, but to the outdoors. In Western North Carolina, the U.S.D.A Forest Service often hosts events, with the support of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, Trout Unlimited, the Western North Carolina Muskie Club, and others.

My small daughters and I left mom behind and set out to enjoy our first kids fishing day this year, on the banks of Lake Powhatan outside Asheville. At ages two and five, I had low expectations for fishing success, but as Thoreau said, many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after, and frankly, we were definitely not after fish.

In fact, our fishing quickly gave way to watching and exploring. We saw a gosling following a pair of adult geese around the pond. We watched a small turtle come to the surface, stick its nose out for a minute, and dive again to sights unseen. We hiked down below the pond and explored the trails along the small mountain stream reemerging at the base of the concrete dam.

More important than learning to tie a knot or tricking a fish into getting hooked was the girls’ fascination about the animals and the curiosity what was a little further down the trail. 

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
