## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The story goes that fall foliage was such a vibrant red that someone likened it to the devil’s britches. The name stuck to the Devil’s Britches hiking trail and now Devil’s Britches IPA is the name of the latest beer in Highland Brewing Company’s seasonal line-up. Highland Brewing has established a strong tradition of naming their seasonal beers after area mountain features, which segued nicely into a partnership with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy, a local land trust which has done much to protect high-elevation land in the area.

Other seasonal beers in the series are named for Little Hump, in the Roan Highlands; Razor Mountain in northeast Buncombe County; Clawhammer Mountain outside Brevard; and Thunderstruck Ridge in Jackson County. These beers are officially unveiled at a seasonal release party held at Highland Brewing Company’s tasting room, during which a percentage of pint sales go to the conservancy. Once unveiled, each seasonal beer brings with it a suite of activities, ranging from presentations at the brewery to conservation work days, to hikes to the top of the namesake peaks. The Devil’s Britches Hike is coming up on February 6. The four-mile hike will leave from Cataloochee Ranch where hikers will follow the Bunchberry Trail to the Devil’s Britches Trail.

Visit www.appalachian.org for more information on the partnership and how to sign up for February’s Devil’s Britches hike.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
