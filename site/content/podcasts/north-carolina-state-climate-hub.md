## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Exactly what impact will climate change have on wildlife and what can land managers do about it is one of the biggest questions facing biologists today and one that spans the breadth of fish and wildlife management from the fate of mountain trout to nesting sea turtles.  Here in the Southern Appalachians it’s an especially important question because of our incredible diversity of life, including many rare species isolated on our cold, high mountain tops.

To help answer that over-arching question, the U.S. Geological Survey is setting up eight climate change research centers scattered across the nation. Housed at major universities, these centers will bring together academia and federal natural resource agencies.

In September, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazaar announced that the Southeast’s climate change center would be housed at North Carolina State University which was selected in an open competition by climate science experts from the Department of the Interior, Forest Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Part of the attraction of N.C. State University is that it brings expertise from a broad range of fields and connections within those fields that span the region.

Once up and running, the climate change center at NC State should provide land managers across the Southeast, including the Southern Appalachians, access to the best available science to help guide their decisions.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
