## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently announced 37.2 million dollars in grants to 20 states to support the conservation of threatened and endangered species across the nation, and a portion of that money is coming to the southern Appalachians.

The North Carolina Plant Conservation Program is receiving more than $41,000 to help acquire seven Henderson County acres that are home to an endangered and a threatened plant. Eventually the site may also be home to white-fringeless orchid, a rare plant that has disappeared from North Carolina.

Authorized by Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act, these competitive grants enable states to work with private landowners, conservation groups, and other government agencies to initiate conservation planning efforts and acquire and protect habitat to support the conservation of threatened and endangered species.

In western North Carolina, one of the most notable projects to receive similar funding in recent years was the 2004 purchase of the 4500-acre Needmore Tract along the Little Tennessee River by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. That project received $2 million under the Endangered Species Act as the purchase helped conserve the endangered Appalachian elktoe mussel, and threatened spotfin chub and Virginia spiraea, a river-side plant.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
