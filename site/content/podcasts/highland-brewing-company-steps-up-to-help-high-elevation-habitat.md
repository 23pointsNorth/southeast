## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature

It’s no secret that Asheville has established itself as a beer capital of the country, and the anchor of that status is Highland Brewing Company, the largest and oldest brewer in town. At the beginning of the summer, Highland will begin distributing its summer seasonal beer, Cattail Peak Wheat.

Cattail Peak sits in the Black Mountains, just north of the highest mountain in the Eastern United States – Mount Mitchell. The mountains of the Southern Appalachians are the highest in the east and are home to rare natural communities, like grassy balds and spruce-fir forests, that are in turn home to rare species like the rock-gnome lichen, one of two lichens on the federal endangered species list, and the endangered Carolina northern flying squirrel. Highland Brewing has developed a reputation for naming seasonal beers after prominent area mountain peaks, and now this local company is going to deepen its commitment to those mountains.

Highland has partnered with the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help raise awareness of the beauty and uniqueness of these high peaks and bring attention to efforts to protect them. In the coming weeks, stay tuned to the Highlands website for information on guided hikes to the beers’ namesake peaks, and keep an eye for more information on six packs of Highlands beer.
