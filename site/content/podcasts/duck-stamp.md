## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The 2015-2016 Federal Duck Stamp was recently unveiled, and features a pair of ruddy ducks painted by wildlife artist Jennifer Miller of Olean, New York.  Last fall, a panel of five judges chose Miller’s art from among 186 entries at the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest. Miller is the third woman to win the Federal Duck Stamp Contest.

A federal duck stamp is required for hunting waterfowl. Ninety-eight percent of the proceeds from the Duck Stamp go to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, which supports wetland purchases and conservation easements for the National Wildlife Refuge System. Stamp sales have raised more than $800 million to protect more than 6 million acres of habitat for birds and other wildlife. Though required of waterfowl hunters, birders and other outdoors enthusiasts, artists, and stamp collectors also contribute to conservation by buying Duck Stamps. The stamps are available for purchase online, at many sporting goods and retail stores, and at some post offices and national wildlife refuges. 

This year’s Federal Duck Stamp will cost $25 — up from $15 last year, the first price increase in 24 years.  The increased price will allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to devote more funds to conserving wetlands that benefits birds and many other plants and animals.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
