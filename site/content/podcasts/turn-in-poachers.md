## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Poaching isn’t just about the illegal harvest of elephant tusks and rhino horns – it can be a
serious issue here in the southern Appalachians, impacting game animals, hurting the chances
of recovering endangered species, and affecting our ability to continue harvesting traditional
forest products like ginseng.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission has a new program to help cut animal
poaching by rewarding members of the public who report suspicious activity or provide
knowledge related to wildlife poaching that results in a conviction. The Turn-In-Poachers
program was developed in partnership with the North Carolina Bowhunters Association, with
funding for the rewards coming from money collected from convictions of wildlife law
violations.

These rewards range from $100 to $1,000, depending on the severity of the crime and the fines
assessed by the court. All tips received through the program will remain anonymous. However,
to be eligible for the reward, you must provide the North Carolina Wildlife Resources
Commission with your name and contact information. Tips can be submitted in four ways: at
tipsubmit.com, via the app tipsubmit, via text to 274637, or via phone to 1-855-Wildtip. Visit
ncwildlife.org for more information.
