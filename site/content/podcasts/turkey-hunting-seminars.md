## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the National Wild Turkey Federation are
offering free turkey hunting seminars across North Carolina in March and April in anticipation of
the spring turkey season.

Introductory and advanced seminars are available on a first-come, first-serve basis to all ages,
although participants 16 years and younger will need parental permission to register.

Introductory seminars are designed for novice turkey hunters or those who have never hunted
turkey. Topics will include biology, hunting methods, calls and decoys, firearms and ammo
selection, camouflage clothing, and turkey cleaning and cooking techniques. Advanced
seminars will focus on advanced biology, more complex hunting methods, calls and decoys, and
will include tips and strategies for dealing with stubborn, hard-to-hunt gobblers.

In the mountains, introductory seminars will be March 28 in Murphy and March 30 in Clyde,
while advanced seminars will be March 29 in Murphy and March 31 in Clyde. All seminars will
be from 6:30 â€“ 9:00 p.m.

Pre-registration is required and participants must register online at ncwildlife.org. For more
information call 919-707-0059.

The statewide season for male or bearded turkey is April 9 through May 7, with a youth-only
week from April 2-8.
