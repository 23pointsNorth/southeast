## Transcript

Greetings, and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission will open approximately 1,000 miles of hatchery-supported trout waters in 25 western counties at 7 a.m. on April 5. The season will run through Feb. 28, 2015.

While fishing on hatchery-supported trout waters, anglers can harvest a maximum of seven trout per day, with no minimum size limits or bait restrictions.

Hatchery-supported trout waters are marked by green-and-white signs. Commission staff stocks these waters from March until August every year, depending on the individual stream. Many of these waters are stocked monthly, although some heavily fished waters are stocked more frequently.

Stocked trout are produced primarily in two mountain fish hatcheries operated by the Commission and are distributed along hatchery-supported streams where public access for fishing is available. While hatchery-supported trout waters are open to public fishing, opportunities to fish on many of these streams are available through the support of private landowners. The Commission stressed the importance of respecting private property and offers several tips, including:

- Removing all trash and litter from fishing and parking areas;
- Parking only in designated areas and leaving driveways open for pass-through traffic;
- Closing and/or locking gates after use; and,
- Reporting wildlife violations by calling 1-800-662-7137.

For a complete list of all hatchery-supported trout waters, as well as trout maps and weekly stocking summaries, visit the Commissionâ€™s website at ncwildlife.org.
