## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

BatFest 2011 is nearly upon us.  Sunday, July 31st from 2:00 to 5:30 at the North Carolina Forest Service’s training center in Crossnore, North Carolina you’ll have your chance to learn everything you wanted to know about bats.

The public event kicks off the 2011 Bat Blitz, a three-day event with wildlife biologists from across the Eastern United States coming to Western North Carolina to collect data on the area’s bat populations.

Before their long nights of field work, several of these biologists will share their bat knowledge and experience with the public – offering presentations on topics such as the bats of North Carolina and the importance of bats. As a special treat, there will be a live bat presentation. In addition to the presentations, there will be plenty of activity stations for young and old – from bat face painting to bat box construction.

The Bat Blitz is now in its 10th year. Sponsored by the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network, the event is held in a different Southeastern site each year, and this year happens to be Pisgah National Forest’s turn.

For more information about the BatFest event, or the Bat Blitz effort, visit the website of the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
