## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

In 1910, there were 1251 people living in Cataloochee Valley – divided between Little and Big Cataloochee, making it collectively the largest community in the Smoky Mountains at the time. The coming of Great Smoky Mountains National Park brought an end to the community, but the creation of the park also meant the preservation of several buildings in the Cataloochee Valley, providing us a glimpse of what life was like there one hundred years ago. Unfortunately, recently life in Cataloochee hasn’t been so tranquil.

Park officials are offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individuals responsible for the recent theft of artifacts from the Palmer House in Cataloochee. The missing artifacts, including a trowel, mill pick, and a coffee mill, were taken from locked display cases in the Palmer House where historical information and exhibits are provided for park visitors.

It’s unlawful to disturb or deface historic resources within the park. Perpetrators may be sentenced up to 6 months in jail and fined up to $5,000. Anyone with information as to the possible identity of the individuals responsible for the theft is encouraged to call the tip hotline at 865-436-1580.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
