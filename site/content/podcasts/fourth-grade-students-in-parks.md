## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park invites all 4th-grade students to visit the park as part of the White House's new Every Kid in a Park program. The park offers a variety of activities that fourth graders and their family can enjoy, including guided discovery hikes, educational programs, self-guided junior ranger activities, and special events throughout the year.

Although entry to Great Smoky Mountains National Park is always free, students in the 4th grade can now go to www.everykidinapark.gov and complete an activity to obtain a free annual entry pass to more than 2,000 federal recreation areas, including national parks. Fourth graders and their families can use this pass for free entry to national parks and other federal public lands and waters across the country from September 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016.

The goal of the Every Kid in a Park program is to connect 4th graders with the great outdoors and inspire them to become future environmental stewards, ready to preserve and protect national parks and other public lands for years to come. The program is an important part of the National Park Service's centennial celebration in 2016, which encourages everyone to Find Your Park.
