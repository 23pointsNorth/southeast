## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission is asking for your help determining who and why someone dumped a bear carcass marked in white paint onto a Buncombe County, North Carolina  road.

Anyone with information should call 1-800-662-7137. Callers may remain anonymous. A combined reward of $3,000 is offered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case.

The bear was discovered with “WHATS BRUIN?” written across the head and “w-h-a-t-s” across the claws on the right paw and “b-r-u-i-n” across the claws on the left paw.

The state is currently prosecuting cases from Operation Something Bruin, a multi-agency law enforcement initiative focused on the illegal poaching of bears and other wildlife, at the Haywood County Courthouse.

In February, 2013, state and federal wildlife officials announced the arrests from the four-year undercover investigation in North Carolina and Georgia. Ten defendants were convicted earlier this month in U.S. District Court for federal charges stemming from the undercover investigation.

Operation Something Bruin involved law enforcement from the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, U.S. Forest Service, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
