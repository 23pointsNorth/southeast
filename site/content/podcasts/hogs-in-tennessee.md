## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature

Southern Appalachian Mountain bogs are one of the rarest habitats in the nation, and on my way to visit a North Georgia bog, our guides stopped to check a hog trap – designed to catch the hogs that were rooting in the bog, and damaging some of its rare plants.

Feral hogs can cause tremendous damage to our natural areas, and now Tennessee is going to survey farmers and other rural landowners to get a state-wide estimate of economic damage from feral hogs. The study is being sponsored by the Tennessee Wild Hog Eradication Action Team (WHEAT).

Survey recipients will be chosen at random from a list of farmers and other rural landowners across the state. If a person receives a copy he or she is asked to please complete the survey and return it in the provided postage-paid envelope. Responses will be extremely important to fully assess the impacts wild hogs have on the rural economy and environment.

Survey results will be used to inform landowners, farmers, wildlife managers, extension agents, and legislators. People can learn more about the survey by contacting the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency at (615) 781-6615, that’s (615) 781-6615.
