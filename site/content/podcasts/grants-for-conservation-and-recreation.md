## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

This year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will distribute $1.1 billion to state and territorial fish and wildlife agencies as part of an annual distribution that has become one of the most sustainable sources of funding for conservation and recreation.

In 1937, Congress passed the Pittman-Robertson Act, creating an excise tax on the sale of sporting firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment. Money raised by this tax is distributed to states and funds a variety of projects, including on-the-ground conservation and hunter safety courses. In 1950, Congress passed the Dingell-Johnson Act, creating an excise tax on fishing equipment, electric motors, and motorboat fuel. Money raised by this tax helps support fish conservation and the construction of boat ramps and other river and lake access points. The program reimburses up to 75 percent of the cost of each eligible project, while state fish and wildlife agencies contribute at least 25 percent, generally using hunting and fishing license revenues as the required match.

Over the years, the two programs have generated more than $15 billion. The total distributions this year are $238 million higher than last because of the inclusion of money not distributed last year because of the government sequester, and an increase in tax receipts from sales of firearms and ammunition.

This year, North Carolina received nearly $20 million, while South Carolina received nearly $15 million.
