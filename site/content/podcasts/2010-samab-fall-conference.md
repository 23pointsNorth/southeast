## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

One of the challenges of looking at the Southern Appalachians as a region is that the area is divided into several states, and despite the fact that birds, bears, winds and rivers pay no heed to our political boundaries, coordinating people across those state lines to work together for those natural resources can be a challenge.

To fill that need  comes the Southern Appalachian Man and the Biosphere program, or SAMAB. More than twenty years-old, SAMAB is a consortium of state and federal natural resource agencies working across those political boundaries on issues of shared importance in the Southern Appalachians.  In the past this has included issues such as invasive species and sustainable development.

One of the most important products of the SAMAB collaboration is their annual fall conference, the only event of its kind that brings together non-profits, government agencies, and colleges and universities to look at conservation issues across the Southern Appalachians.  SAMAB’s current focus is on climate change, which will be the focus of their conference for the second year in a row.

This year’s conference will be in Gatlinburg from November 16 through 18th and provides everyone from lay people to professional researchers an opportunity to see what is going on in terms of dealing with climate change in our beautiful region.
