## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

My daughter and I walked past the racks of fishing rods for loan, found a quiet spot on the bank of Lake Powhatan, a Forest Service lake on the edge of Asheville, and settled in for a morning of fishing. We didn’t catch anything, but we still enjoyed the stillness of the spot, and the opportunity to simply observe the natural world around us, from the dragonflies to the turtle that swam by. When we tired of fishing, hot dogs were coming off the grill for lunch.

It was our first Forest Service Kids’ Fishing Day, and the Forest Service has just announced dates for 2014. There will be eleven events across western North Carolina, including four dedicated to kids with special needs.

Designed for children 12 and younger, all children must be accompanied by an adult. No experience is needed for families to participate.  Fishing equipment is available for loan, and plenty of fishing experts are on hand to offer guidance. The fishing events are conducted as part of National Fishing and Boating Week, June 1-8.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission co-sponsers the event, which also receives support from Trout Unlimited, the Western North Carolina Muskie Club, and the Cradle of Forestry.

For the dates and locations of the Fishing Day events closest to you, contact your nearest U.S. Forest Service office.
