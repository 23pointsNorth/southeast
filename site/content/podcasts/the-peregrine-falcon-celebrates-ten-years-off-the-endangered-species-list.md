## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

2009 marks the 10-year anniversary of the removal of the peregrine falcon, the world’s fastest bird, from the national threatened and endangered species list.

Key players in the falcon’s continued success are rock climbers. In the Southern Appalachians, peregrines nest on the high, broad cliff faces that are also popular with climbers. However, disturbance during nesting season can cause adult falcons to abandon a nest or spook young birds out of the nest before they can fly, essentially plummeting to their death. From January to August the Forest Service closes certain climbing routes in sensitive areas, and climber cooperation in respecting these closures is essential. To find out about possible closures in your climbing area, contact your nearest USDA Forest Service office.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
