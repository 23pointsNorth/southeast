## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

As efforts to address climate change build steam, several questions loom about how this phenomenon will affect the Southern Appalachians and how local land managers can respond. That conversation is about to reach a whole new level.

The Southern Appalachian Man and the Biosphere program, or SAMAB, is a consortium of federal and state natural resource agencies interested in the conservation and sustainable development of the Southern Appalachians. In late November, the 20th annual SAMAB Fall Conference, to be held in Asheville, is going to look at how climate change will play out on our regional level, and what land managers can do about it.

Among the sessions offered is a panel looking just at impacts to brook trout, our native trout. Another panel will explore local land planning, including landslide mapping, growth trends, and protecting important natural areas at the local level. Other speakers will look at expected changes to our forests in the coming years.

The Southern Appalachians is an incredibly diverse area - home to high peaks, rare wetlands, and vibrant rivers - and this rich natural heritage, which forms the foundation of a thriving tourism industry, is incredibly susceptible to the effects of climate change. This conference is a big step in preparing our communities – both natural and developed – for the changes to come. For more information, visit www.SAMAB.org.
