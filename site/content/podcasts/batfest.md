## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Bats are an incredibly important part of our world – helping control insect populations and pollinating plants. Despite all of this, bats still suffer from an image problem based on ill-conceived notions that they’re aggressive toward people and are rampant transmitters of rabies

However, bat biologists are offering you a chance to have all your questions about bats answered during BatFest 2011, an educational event from 2 to 5:30 p.m. at the North Carolina State Forestry training center in Crossnore, North Carolina.

The afternoon will be filled with presentations and demonstrations about bats from wildlife biologists, including a discussion of the bats of North Carolina, and a live bat show. The event will also have plenty of activities for children, ranging from simple face painting to bat games to bat house construction.

A deeper and wider understanding of the importance of bats is especially important given that the future of many species has been called into question by the arrival and spread of white-nose syndrome, a disease deadly to bats that has decimated populations in parts of the Eastern United States.

BatFest kicks off the 2011 Bat Blitz, an event that brings wildlife biologists from across the Eastern United States to Avery County, North Carolina for three days of intensive field work capturing and collecting data from the area’s bats.
