## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

People across the United States now have an incredibly simple way to help protect animals like tigers, rhinos and gorillas. The U.S. Postal Service recently issued the Save Vanishing Species Stamp, the first U.S. postal stamp ever issued to raise funds for international wildlife conservation. Proceeds directly benefit the Wildlife Without Borders Multinational Species Conservation Funds, administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Since 1989, the Wildlife Without Borders Program has saved tigers, rhinos, elephants, gorillas, chimpanzees, sea turtles and other endangered species.

The stamp features an Amur tiger cub and sells for 55 cents - just slightly above the cost of first-class postage. The Amur tiger is a success story of the Wildlife Without Borders Program. Sixty years ago there were less than 50 adult Amur tigers in the wild.  Today Russia is home to approximately 400 Amur tigers.

The Save Vanishing Species stamp will remain on sale for at least two years as authorized by Congress. The Multinational Species Conservation Funds support conservation directed at certain endangered species worldwide considered to be of great importance to the American public. These include African and Asian elephants, tigers, rhinoceros, great apes, and sea turtles.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
