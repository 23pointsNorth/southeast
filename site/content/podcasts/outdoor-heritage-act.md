## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

North Carolina governor Pat McCrory recently signed into law the Outdoor Heritage Act. The act does a handful of things, the one that has gotten the most attention is that it allows for hunting on Sundays with the use of firearms on private property with written permission from the landowner, beginning Oct. 1, with the following provisions:

- Hunting on Sunday between 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. is prohibited, except on controlled, licensed hunting preserves.
- Hunting of migratory game birds on Sunday is prohibited.
- The use of a firearm to take deer that are run or chased by dogs on Sunday is prohibited.
- Hunting on Sunday within 500 yards of a place of worship or any accessory structure, or within 500 yards of a residence not owned by the landowner, is prohibited.
- Hunting on Sunday in a county having a population greater than 700,000 people is prohibited â€” affecting Wake and Mecklenburg counties only.

Since September 2010 North Carolinians have been hunting on Sundays on private lands by falconry and with archery equipment.

What has gotten less attention is the legislation creates an Outdoor Heritage Council, and a trust fund to engage youth in the outdoors. The law takes effect Oct. 1.
