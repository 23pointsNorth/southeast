## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

There’s a long list of reasons why we should protect our biodiversity – the variety of genes, species, and natural communities found in our world. One reason that’s becoming increasingly understood and appreciated is that biodiversity protects ecosystem services. Ecosystem services is a somewhat obtuse way to describe all those things the natural world does for us – from plants producing oxygen to wetlands cleaning water.

One of the most important ecosystem services is pollination – fertilizing plants with pollen, a simple act that enables flowering plants to reproduce and provides us with nearly every fruit we eat. For a lot of species, animals play a key role in pollinization, and though we often think of insects like honeybees or butterflies performing this role, pollination is done by a variety of animals, including bats and hummingbirds.

To help conserve these pollinators, the Fish & Wildlife Service is participating in the North American Pollinator Protection Campaign’s year-long "Take Action for Pollinators" Campaign to promote the health of pollinators. The Take Action for Pollinators website, found at pollinator.org slash TAP provides a list of actions people can take to help support pollinators in their community. The list includes a number of ideas that Southern Appalachian gardeners can include in their planning for spring gardens, including creating butterfly or hummingbird garden, or planting for bees.
