## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Head outdoors and enjoy some of the country’s most magical places — America’s National Wildlife Refuges offer unparalleled opportunities to experience the great outdoors and see a rich diversity of wildlife in beautiful natural settings. If that wasn’t enticement enough, refuges that normally charge entrance fees will offer an additional incentive — free admission on these days in 2016:

- January 18 – Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
- February 13-15 – Presidents’ Day Weekend
- September 24 – National Public Lands Day
- October 9 – First Sunday of National Wildlife Refuge Week
- November 11-13 – Veterans Day weekend

The National Wildlife Refuge System, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is the nation’s premier habitat conservation network, encompassing more than 150 million acres. Most refuges admit the public free year-round, but a few normally charge a small entrance fee to cover maintenance and visitor services.

America is becoming increasingly urban, making it more important than ever to ensure our next generation grows up with a connection to wildlife and the outdoors. Other federal land management agencies that will offer free admission days in 2016 are: the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Forest Service. Please contact each for details.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
