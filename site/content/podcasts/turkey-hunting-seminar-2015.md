## Transcript

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the National Wild Turkey Federation are offering free turkey hunting seminars in Henderson County’s Mills River community on April 1st and 2nd in anticipation of the upcoming spring turkey season.

The April 1st seminar will be an introduction to turkey hunting, designed for novice hunters or those who have never hunted turkey and would like to learn more. Topics will include biology, hunting methods, calls and decoys, firearms and ammo selection, camouflage clothing, and turkey cleaning and cooking techniques.

The April 2nd seminar will be for experienced turkey hunters. It will focus on advanced biology, and more complex hunting tactics, calls, and decoys. The advanced seminar will also include tips and strategies for dealing with stubborn, hard-to-hunt gobblers.

The seminars will be from 6:30-8:30 p.m. at the Mountain Horticulture Crops Research and Extension Center. They are open on a first-come, first-serve basis to all ages, although participants 16 years and younger will need parental permission to register.

The statewide season for male turkeys is April 11th through May 9th, with a youth-only week April 4th-10th.

Pre-registration for the turkey hunting seminars is required. For more information, or to register, contact Casey Williams at 919-707-0202 that’s 919-707-0202.
