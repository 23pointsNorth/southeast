## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

A lot of people in the Southern Appalachians take their fly fishing seriously. Come March, anglers will get an opportunity to test their skills head to head against anglers from across the region as the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and Davidson River Outfitters host the fourth annual Pisgah Fly Masters fly-fishing tournament.

The tournament will be March 19th and 20th in Transylvania County, North Carolina. Competitors will be divided into three categories â€“ youth, fisherman, and professional.  A casting competition on March 19 will determine the field in the three categories for the catch-and-release trout fishing finals on the Davidson River, March 20th.

Proceeds will support the Pisgah Center for Wildlife Education, a North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission regional learning and visitor facility outside Brevard. The Center offers free programming for children and adults on wildlife topics including aquatic habitats, fly fishing, and fly tying.

Entry fees are $30 for ages 10 to 15 and $50 for anglers 16 and older. Those registered by March 3 will receive a 2011 tournament T-shirt. For more information call, 828-877-4423.
