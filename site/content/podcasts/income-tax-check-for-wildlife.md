## Transcript

Welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

Tax time approaches, and in North Carolina this provides an easy opportunity to support wildlife conservation.

Taxpayers can help conserve North Carolina’s nongame wildlife by donating a portion of their state income tax refund to the Nongame and Endangered Wildlife Fund by checking on line 30 of their state tax form.  Nongame wildlife includes all the birds, mammals, fish, mollusks, reptiles, amphibians, and crayfish that do not have a designated hunting or fishing season.

The Commission uses the donations to support wildlife research, conservation and management, including monitoring populations of red-cockaded woodpeckers and peregrine falcons, managing bog turtle habitat, surveying for gopher frogs, developing captive breeding techniques for mussels, and for research and future restoration efforts.

Donations make up the largest and most significant source of non-federal funding to help these animals, so they’re critical to many projects. Current work includes surveys to determine the abundance and distribution of sea turtles along the coast, robust redhorse in the Piedmont, and golden eagles in the mountains. Through surveys, biologists collect data that help them determine the most effective ways to manage wildlife and their habitats, ensuring that species thrive in a state where habitat continues to disappear at an alarming rate.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
