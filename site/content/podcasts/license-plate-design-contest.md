## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Feature.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, in partnership with students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, is holding a contest to generate a new license plate design for the Commission’s Wildlife Diversity Program, which does research, conservation and monitoring work benefiting nongame animals such as songbirds, sea turtles, eagles, salamanders, frogs, turtles, and bats.

The Commission wants to update the current license plate logo, which features a northern cardinal and dogwood blossom, to a more striking image that reflects North Carolina’s native plants and animals. The contest is open to anyone but minors must submit parental permission with their entries.

Entry guidelines include:

No more than five colors
The design must include any nongame animal native to North Carolina, with a special preference for the marbled salamander or the Pine Barrens treefrog, both official state amphibians.
The design may include a native plant with the native, nongame animal and both must be found together in the wild.
Entries must be submitted electronically and are due by April 15.

After a new license plate design is selected by Commission, the agency will promote and market it to replace the current license plate. Changing the current design requires final approval from the Department of Motor Vehicles.

Additional information and guidelines can be found at the Commission’s website, NCwildlife.org
