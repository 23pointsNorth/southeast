## Transcript

Greetings and welcome to the Southern Appalachian Creature Features.

On the heels of numerous pollinator gardens being installed in western North Carolina, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency has announced a major effort to help save monarch butterflies.

The agency, along with the National Wildlife Federation, Tennessee Wildlife Federation, Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation, Mississippi River Corridor and The Nature Conservancy are partnering with Roundstone Native Seed Company to save the butterflies.

The “Save the Monarchs Campaign” will supply seeds for native wildflower gardens from Roundstone Native Seed Company to any Tennessee individual or group that wishes to participate. The seeds include a mix of native, nectar-producing flowering plants and milkweeds, which are required to support healthy monarch populations.

Monarch butterfly populations have declined more than 90 percent in just the past 20 years. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering placing the butterfly on the endangered species list. However, key to reversing the decline is having plenty of milkweed on the landscape.

Tennessee school groups, non-profits, neighborhood associations and individuals can apply for the seed packets. For information on receiving these seeds, call (615) 781-6643, that’s 615/781-6643.

Each seed packet will cover approximately 15 square feet. Recipients of the seed packets are urged to plant these seeds in open spaces, such as gardens or flowerboxes.

For WNCW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this is Gary Peeples.
