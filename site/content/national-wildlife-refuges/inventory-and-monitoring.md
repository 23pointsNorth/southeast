The Regional Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) branch is designed to address the [National Wildlife Refuge System](https://fws.gov/refuges) (NWRS) critical information needs and to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation strategies on [national wildlife refuges across the Southeast](https://usfws.github.io/southeast-mega-map/?layers=refuges&layers=Refuge+boundaries). I&M assesses the status of NWRS lands, waters, and biota and provides monitoring support, expertise, and advice to refuges and partners in the face of accelerating climate change and threats from other environmental stressors. The primary purpose of the I&M is to provide information support management decisions at multiple geographic scales.

[Learn more about the national I&M program](https://www.fws.gov/Refuges/NaturalResourcePC/IandM/).

## Status and Needs Assessment

The regional I&M branch published a [Status and Needs Assessment report](/pdf/report/inventory-and-monitoring-status-and-needs-assessement-gulf-zone-2014.pdf) (2.48MB) that summarizes information collected from 65 refuges located in the Gulf Zone.  These data provide a broader picture of monitoring in the Gulf and helped to identify opportunities to coordinate and improve data collection, data management, and analysis. The most outstanding opportunities identified within the Southeast Region Gulf Zone are presented in this report with additional data and information included in the associated [Appendices](/pdf/report/inventory-and-monitoring-status-and-needs-assessement-appendices-gulf-zone-2014.pdf) (2.10MB). For more information about this effort, please contact the I&M Branch chief, Janet Ertel.

## Inventory and Monitoring Plans

[The Refuge Inventory and Monitoring policy](https://www.fws.gov/policy/701fw2.html) requires each refuge to develop and follow an Inventory and Monitoring Plan (IMP) that identifies surveys to be conducted in the next 10 to 15 years. These plans are step-down plans for refuge [Comprehensive Conservation Plans](/reading-room?q=Comprehensive+Conservation+Plan) and [Habitat Management Plans](/reading-room?q=Habitat+Management+Plan).

The Inventory and Monitoring Plan documents the priority and selection of surveys to assess the status and trends of natural resources and the effectiveness of management conservation actions. IMPs also document resource needs and capacity challenges for refuges and can be easily revised to address shifts in priorities due to environmental change.

[Search Inventory and Monitoring Plans in the Southeast](/reading-room?q=Inventory+and+Monitoring+Plan).

## Data Management

Regional I&M branch staff are developing, testing, and using a number of data management systems to help the NWRS accomplish mission goals and inform management decisions at all levels. Learn more about [data management in the Southeast](/data-management), or check out the complete list of [conservation tools](/conservation-tools).

## Monitoring Activities

Informed planning and resource management requires information about status, trends, and changes in fish, wildlife, plant populations, and their habitats. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) Inventory & Monitoring (I&M) Initiative and Southeast Region I&M Branch efforts are focused on both [biotic](/national-wildlife-refuges/biotic-resources) and [abiotic resources](/national-wildlife-refuges/abiotic-resources).

## Contact

Staff are stationed strategically at refuge and partner offices across the southeast region to provide local, regional, and national coordination.
