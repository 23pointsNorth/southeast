Hunting is part of our American heritage and is a huge economic contributor to the conservation of our nation’s wildlife and habitats. Through the [Pittman-Robertson Act](http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/GrantPrograms/WR/WR_Act.htm), American hunters and shooters contributed [over $800 million](http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/GrantPrograms/WR/WRFinalApportionment2015.pdf) to conservation projects nationwide last year.

We offer seasonal hunting opportunities on a variety of southeastern national wildlife refuges. You can hunt a range of species including white-tailed deer, waterfowl, turkey and even help control wild hogs.

## How to Hunt on Refuges

In order to hunt on a national wildlife refuge, you need to have two things:

1. A state hunting license and
2. A refuge hunting permit.
