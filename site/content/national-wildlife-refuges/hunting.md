Hunting is part of our American heritage and is a huge economic contributor to the conservation of our nation’s wildlife and habitats. Through the [Pittman-Robertson Act](http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/GrantPrograms/WR/WR_Act.htm), American hunters and shooters contributed [over $800 million](http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/GrantPrograms/WR/WRFinalApportionment2015.pdf) to conservation projects nationwide last year.

We offer seasonal hunting opportunities on a variety of southeastern national wildlife refuges. You can hunt a range of species including white-tailed deer, waterfowl, turkey and even help control wild hogs.

## How to hunt on refuges

In order to hunt on a national wildlife refuge, you need to have two things:

1. A refuge hunting permit
2. A state hunting license

## Find a refuge hunt

Use our [hunt search tool](https://www.fws.gov/refuges/hunting/) to find the perfect hunt for you and/or your family. After finding your hunt, visit the refuge website to find hunt maps and more information.  Hunting Regulations for all of the Southeastern National Wildlife Refuges can be found in the [reading room](/reading-room/?search=Hunt).
