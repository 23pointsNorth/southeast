## Coastal Wetland Elevation Monitoring

Sea level rise and its potential impacts to habitats and species are a concern for the refuges across the United States. Rising sea levels can lead to wetland loss, saltwater intrusion, habitat conversion, and inland migration of marsh and forested ecosystems. The average mean elevation of these wetland surfaces must increase to keep pace with the annual rise in sea level and land subsidence of organic substrates. Understanding rates of wetland elevation change and relative sea-level rise is important to help refuge managers answer critical questions and adjust management techniques for wetlands towards future conditions.

In the Southeast region, the I&M Branch initiated a Coastal Wetland Elevation Monitoring (CWEM) effort on 18 refuges within the South Atlantic geography in 2012. The overarching CWEM objectives are to observe impacts of sea level rise and change in priority habitats, determine rates of wetland elevation change and relative sea level rise, and forecast longevity of these habitats in refuges within the SALCC geography. This monitoring effort involves collecting surface elevation (surveying and rod surface elevation tables [RSET]), accretion, porewater salinity, and vegetation community data at permanent sites to provide data to refuge managers on the status of and trends in wetland conditions within refuges. The data collected will help managers make better ecologically-informed decisions with regards to conservation and management of wetlands on refuges.

I&M is are partnering with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), The Nature Conservancy, the National Park Service (NPS), the SALCC, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS), and the National Geodetic Survey to accomplish many aspects of this project. Furthermore, the data collected from this project will be used in conjunction with similar data collected from RSET benchmarks maintained by the NPS, the NERRS, and USGS to better examine landscape-scale changes resulting from sea level rise.

 - This year, project participants will continue to collect RSET, accretion, and porewater salinity data from all sites. Other project highlights include:
 - The Southeast and Southwest Regional I&M staff are working together to develop a multi-regional Coastal Wetland Elevation Monitoring protocol.
 - In summer 2016, vegetation monitoring was conducted at all sites, and the Resample Vegetation Report will be finalized in 2017.
 - In 2015 and 2016, static GPS surveys were conducted at most CWEM sites, and the Baseline RSET Benchmark Elevation Report will be finalized in 2017.

## Fire Ecology and Effects Monitoring

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/fire-effects-monitoring.jpg" alt="Two biologists measure vegetation height in the understory of an open pine stand." caption="Fire Effects Monitoring. Photo by USFWS." >}}

The Service recognizes the importance and role of fire in ecosystems in the Southeast. The Southeast Region I&M Branch works closely with the National Fire Ecology team, NWRS I&M Initiative, and Southeast Region Fire Management Division to develop tools for monitoring and understanding fire ecology and management on refuges. Some of the current efforts include the development of Fire Atlases, Fire Management Species Profiles, and Fire Monitoring Plan/Field Guide.

### Fire Atlases

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/fire-effects-monitoring-workshop.jpg" alt="A group of four attendees gather around a Service leader." caption="Fire Effects Monitoring Workshop, Carolina Sandhills NWR. Photo by Rob Wood, USFWS." >}}

The Southeast Region I&M Branch and the National Fire Management Branch are working together to develop fire atlases for refuges across the Southeast Region. The objective is to develop parcel-specific fire occurrence and fire intensity histories based on 30-m Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. A Fire Atlas is a spatial dataset of historical fire boundaries for both wildfires and prescribed burns. The resulting spatial and temporally explicit dataset will allow comparisons to be made between fire history and current habitat characteristics,. This data is useful particularly in reference to managing and restoring optimal conditions for listed or imperiled species, and species of concern for a refuge. To date, Fire Atlases have been developed for [Big Branch Marsh](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/big_branch_marsh/), [Sabine](https://www.fws.gov/swlarefugecomplex/sabine/), and [St. Marks](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/st_marks/) NWRs. Current Fire Atlas projects include [Grand Bay](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/grand_bay/) and [Mississippi Sandhill Crane](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/mississippi_sandhill_crane/) NWRs. For more information contact coastal ecologist [Sue Wilder, sue_wilder@fws.gov](mailto:sue_wilder@fws.gov).

### Fire Management Species Profiles

In collaboration with the [Southeast Region Fire Management Division,](/our-services/fire) the Southeast Region I&M branch has developed Fire Management Profiles for several species including: [Bachman's sparrow](/pdf/fire/bachmans-sparrow-fire-management.pdf), [Henslows sparrow](/pdf/fire/henslows-sparrow-fire-management.pdf), [Little bluestem](/pdf/fire/little-bluestem-fire-management.pdf), [Wiregrass](/pdf/fire/wiregrass-fire-management.pdf), [Pine snake](/pdf/fire/pine-snake-fire-management.pdf), [Painted bunting](/pdf/fire/painted-bunting-fire-management.pdf), and [Brown-headed nuthatch](/pdf/fire/brownheaded-nuthatch-fire-management.pdf). The objective of the Fire Management Species Profile project is to identify habitat management objectives that are specific, measurable, achievable, clearly communicate among habitat management professionals, and are firmly based in the best available science. Their use is intended to guide habitat managers in setting local objectives for habitat management in fire-adapted ecological systems. Fire management objectives are specific to habitat conditions in which maintenance and improvement, rather than restoration, of habitat condition is the goal.

### Fuel Treatment Effects Monitoring

A revised Fuel Treatment Effects Monitoring Field Guide and an Interim Fuel Treatment Effects Monitoring Plan have been developed and are currently available. The purpose of these regional documents is to provide technical and planning guidance on fuels treatment monitoring activities on refuges in the Southeast. The Plan serves as the regional monitoring plan, and the revised Field Guide provides information on field methods, sampling design, data collection, storage and reporting fuels treatment monitoring data. I&M Branch staff have been conducting Fire Effects Monitoring workshops across the region to train fire staff on the new Field Guide techniques. For more information contact botanist, [Forbes Boyle, maxwell_boyle@fws.gov](mailto:maxwell_boyle@fws.gov), or coastal ecologist [Sue Wilder, sue_wilder@fws.gov](mailto:sue_wilder@fws.gov).

## Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) Analysis

HGM analysis is a three-step process used to evaluate riparian and wetland ecosystems and surrounding landscapes. HGMIt is used to identify options for restoring areas to their original functions, before human induced alterations, all within the context of landscape-scale conservation and species preservation. The HGM process is outlined below:

{{< figure class="photo-center" src="/images/pages/cape-romain-nwr-wetland.jpg" alt="A wetland emerges from open water with shrubs in the foreground." caption="Cape Romain NWR. Photo by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS." >}}

  - The first step in an HGM analysis is to evaluate the historic conditions of the land and its surroundings by studying the soil, vegetation, topography, hydrology, flora, and fauna.
  - The second step is to evaluate how the land has been altered through manipulation of drainage systems, topography, or vegetation communities, and how those changes have affected the natural ecological processes. Current conditions are assessed as well as each community’s resilience to change and potential for restoration.
  - The third step is to identify strategies for restoring an area to the historical condition within the context of the larger landscape. Common approaches might involve removal of invasive species or undoing human-induced changes to hydrology.

## Water Resource Inventory and Assessment

{{< figure class="photo-right" src="/images/pages/cahaba-river.jpg" alt="A shallow river running across rocks in front of a pine tree covered shore." caption="Cahaba River NWR. Photo by USFWS." >}}

Water plays an incredibly important role throughout the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). An accurate understanding of water quantity and quality is essential to identify the habitat needs of species and the threats they face on refuge lands. An accurate inventory of water resources allows refuge managers to prioritize the work of their staff.  A water resource inventory and assessment (WRIA) is the first step to understanding the for a targeted water monitoring effort.

 - The WRIA effort includes a centralized database that allows employees to retrieve water resource information from across the NWRS.
 - The inventory component of the WRIA will gather existing information about each refuge’s water features and supply, water quality, water rights, water-related infrastructure, needs and threats.
 - The WRIA process also provides a written assessment including station-specific information that will guide water resource management for that individual refuge.
