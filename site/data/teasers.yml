    summary: 'A quarter of a million people visit Pinckney Island National Wildlife Refuge every year. But Alice Boyd remembers a time when visitors to Pinckney Island — the largest of five islands in the 4,053-acre refuge, and the only one open to the public — could be counted in the dozens, the island was accessible only by boat and she and her brother were the only children for miles around.'

    summary: 'Amidst catastrophic population declines leaving fewer than 200 known pairs in existence in the early 1970s, the Kirtland’s warbler seemed to be rapidly heading towards extinction. But after decades of partnership efforts among federal and state agencies, industry and conservation groups, this songbird has rebounded, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is now proposing to remove the Kirtland’s warbler from the list of endangered and threatened species. The proposal opens a 90-day public comment period that will help inform a final decision.'

    summary: 'Thanks to the proactive work of state and federal law enforcement professionals, an Arkansas-based live fish distributor is no longer illegally transporting and selling nonnative grass carp in Indiana.  Following complaints from concerned parties, conservation officers within the investigation section of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources worked closely with special agents within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement to investigate and quickly close this case. On February 27, 2017, Arkansas Pondstockers paid two citations in federal court totalling $12,060.'

    summary: 'We’ve all heard the phrase, “It takes a village to raise a child,” but one Georgia neighborhood found that it actually takes a village to raise a small orchid population.  Called Big Canoe, this neighborhood is located in Pickens County, and is home to the Meadows Committee, a dedicated group of individuals committed to stewarding the Big Canoe Conservation Easement, held by North American Land Trust (NALT).  After a NALT Conservation Biologist discovered the existence of the rare White Fringeless Orchid on this permanently protected Conservation Area, the Meadows Committee learned just how much work and coordination goes into rehabilitating a species.  And thanks to enthusiastic partnerships and the hard work of everyone involved, this orchid was able to grow and flourish into a rare beauty.'
