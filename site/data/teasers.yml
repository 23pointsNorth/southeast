    summary: 'For decades, Reese Thompson didn’t fully appreciate the ground beneath his feet. As a sixth-generation tree farmer, he valued his thousands of acres in Wheeler County, Georgia, mostly for its output—the saw timber, chip-n-saw, and pulpwood provided by the fast-growing slash pines on his land. But all that changed about 13 years ago when a botanist friend of his knelt amid an untouched stand of longleaf pines on Thompson’s farm and quickly counted off 29 plant species within a square yard.'

    summary: 'We’ve all heard the phrase, “It takes a village to raise a child,” but one Georgia neighborhood found that it actually takes a village to raise a small orchid population.  Called Big Canoe, this neighborhood is located in Pickens County, and is home to the Meadows Committee, a dedicated group of individuals committed to stewarding the Big Canoe Conservation Easement, held by North American Land Trust (NALT).  After a NALT Conservation Biologist discovered the existence of the rare White Fringeless Orchid on this permanently protected Conservation Area, the Meadows Committee learned just how much work and coordination goes into rehabilitating a species.  And thanks to enthusiastic partnerships and the hard work of everyone involved, this orchid was able to grow and flourish into a rare beauty.'
