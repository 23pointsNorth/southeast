    summary: 'Tucked behind two gates, across a road of gravel and dirt, stands a tall net. Gary Jordan, a biologist from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Raleigh office, is hoping bats fly into this and four nets scattered across Resource Management Service’s land in Brunswick County. Every 10 minutes, almost like clockwork, Jordan completes a lap of the nets, his light only shining on twine during the first few hours.'

    summary: 'We’ve all heard the phrase, “It takes a village to raise a child,” but one Georgia neighborhood found that it actually takes a village to raise a small orchid population.  Called Big Canoe, this neighborhood is located in Pickens County, and is home to the Meadows Committee, a dedicated group of individuals committed to stewarding the Big Canoe Conservation Easement, held by North American Land Trust (NALT).  After a NALT Conservation Biologist discovered the existence of the rare White Fringeless Orchid on this permanently protected Conservation Area, the Meadows Committee learned just how much work and coordination goes into rehabilitating a species.  And thanks to enthusiastic partnerships and the hard work of everyone involved, this orchid was able to grow and flourish into a rare beauty.'
