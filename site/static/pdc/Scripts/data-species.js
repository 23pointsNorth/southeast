        desc: "The northern long-eared bat is a medium sized bat about 3 to 3.7 inches in length with a wingspan of 9 to 10 inches and is distinguished by its long ears.  Its fur color can range from medium to dark brown on the back and tawny to pale-brown on the underside.  The northern long-eared bat can be found in much of the eastern and north central United States and all Canadian provinces from the Atlantic Ocean west to the southern Yukon Territory and eastern British Columbia.  Northern long-eared bats can be found in mixed pine/hardwood forest with intermittent streams.  Northern long-eared bats roost alone or in small colonies underneath bark or in cavities or crevices of both live trees and snags (dead trees).  During the winter, northern long-eared bats can be found hibernating in caves and abandoned mines, although none have been documented using caves in Louisiana.  Northern long-eared bats emerge at dusk to fly through the understory of forested hillsides and ridges to feed on moths, flies, leafhoppers, caddis flies and beetles, which they catch using echolocation.  This bat can also feed by gleaning motionless insects from vegetation and water surfaces.  In Louisiana, there have been confirmed reports of sightings in Winn and Grant parishes; although they can possibly be found in other parishes in the state.  Some individuals were documented during mist net and bridge surveys on the Winn District of the Kisatchie National Forest and were also observed under bridges on the Catahoula District in Grant Parish.  At this time, there are no known hibernacula or maternity roost trees in Louisiana although there are surveys currently being conducted."

The American chaffseed is a tall perennial herb in the snapdragon family, and can be identified by its two-inch-long, purplish-yellow, tubular flowers.  The plant, a partial parasite on the roots of other plants, grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches at the time of flowering in the spring.  Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped to elliptic, and its flowers are borne singularly on short stalks.  The fruit is a long, narrow capsule enclosed in a sac-like structure.  Flowering occurs from April to June and fruits mature in early summer."

Saline prairies are characterized by low, extensive coverage of sedges, grasses, and forbs, with few to no trees or shrubs.  They are interspersed with bare soil areas (slicks) that provide habitat for earth fruit.  The earth fruit is a tiny annual plant that completes its life cycle within 4 to 6 weeks and is rarely visible except during the flowering stage in March and April.  The flowers, which are inconspicuous in the leaf axils, have a greenish-red calyx and no petals.  The fruit (a capsule) splits open into three parts at maturity, releasing numerous 0.02-inch-long seeds.  Young plants are dull gray, turn reddish-purple at maturity, and then diminish at the end of the life cycle.  Under optimal conditions, the seeds remain in the nearby earth until the following spring when they complete another life cycle."

It has not been seen in Louisiana since 1965 and is presently known to survive at only one site in Mississippi.  The dusky gopher frog is a darkly-colored, moderately-sized frog with warts covering its back and dusky spots on its belly.  The dusky gopher frog’s habitat includes both upland, sandy areas covered with longleaf pine; and isolated, temporary, wetland breeding sites within the forested landscape.  Adult frogs spend most of their lives underground in forests with an open canopy and abundant ground cover.  They use active and abandoned gopher tortoise burrows, abandoned mammal burrows and holes in and under stumps as their underground retreats.  Breeding sites are isolated ponds that dry out completely at certain times of the year.  Substantial winter rains are needed to ensure that ponds are filled sufficiently to allow development of juvenile frogs."

The black bill tapers steadily from a relatively thick base to a relatively fine tip; bill length is not much longer than head length.  Legs are typically dark gray to black, but sometimes greenish in juveniles or older birds in non-breeding plumage.  Non-breeding (winter) plumage is dusky gray above and whitish below, while breeding (summer) plumage is rufous (red) on the face, breast, and upper belly.  The red knot breeds in the central Canadian arctic (June through mid-July) but can be found in Louisiana from August through mid-May during spring and fall migrations and the winter months.  During migration and on their wintering grounds, red knots forage along sandy beaches, tidal mudflats, salt marshes, and peat banks.  Observations along the Texas coast indicate that red knots forage on beaches, oyster reefs, and exposed bay bottoms, and they roost on high sand flats, reefs, and other sites protected from high tides.  In wintering and migration habitats, red knots commonly forage on bivalves, gastropods, and crustaceans.  Coquina clams (<i>Donax variabilis</i>), a frequent and often important food resource for red knots, are common along many gulf beaches.  Major threats to this species along the Gulf of Mexico include the loss and degradation of habitat and reduced prey availability due to erosion, shoreline stabilization, and development, and disturbance by humans and pets."

It also can be found less regularly in other Louisiana coastal areas, most likely while the average water temperature is warm.  Based on data maintained by the Louisiana Natural Heritage Program, over 80 percent of reported manatee sightings (1999-2011) in Louisiana have occurred from the months of June through December.  Manatee occurrences in Louisiana appear to be increasing and they have been regularly reported in the Amite, Blind, Tchefuncte, and Tickfaw Rivers, and in canals within the adjacent coastal marshes of southeastern Louisiana.  Manatees may also infrequently be observed in the Mississippi River and coastal areas of southwestern Louisiana. Cold weather and outbreaks of red tide may adversely affect these animals.  However, human activity has been the primary cause for declines in species’ number due to collisions with boats and barges, entrapment in flood control structures, poaching, habitat loss, and pollution."

The lower 1/3 of the Amite River (between Louisiana Highway 37 and Louisiana Highway 42) has not been used widely for past or present gravel mining operations and is, therefore, more typical of a coastal plain river.  This reach is characterized by a silt substratum, less channelization, and slower water flow, all of which are characteristic of heelsplitter habitat.  This freshwater mussel is typically found in soft, stable substrates; such as sand, mud, silt, and sandy gravel, in slow to moderate currents.  Heelsplitter mussels are usually found in depositional pools below sand point bars and in shallow pools between sandbars and river banks.  The Alabama heelsplitter has an oval, compressed to moderately inflated, thin shell.  The valves may gape anteriorly. The umbos are low, and there is a prominent posterior wing.  The shell is brown to black and may have green rays in young individuals.  The umbonal cavity is very shallow, and the inner shell layer is pink to purple. Maximum shell length is about 5 1/2 inches in adults."

        desc: "The piping plover is a small (7 inches long), pale, sand-colored shorebird that winters in coastal Louisiana and may be present for 8 to 10 months annually.  Piping plovers arrive from their northern breeding grounds as early as late July and remain until late March or April.  They feed on polychaete marine worms, various crustaceans, insects and their larvae, and bivalve mollusks that they peck from the top of or just beneath the sand.  Piping plovers forage on intertidal beaches, mudflats, sand flats, algal flats, and wash-over passes with no or very sparse emergent vegetation.  They roost in unvegetated or sparsely vegetated areas, which may have debris, detritus, or micro-topographic relief offering refuge to plovers from high winds and cold weather.  They also forage and roost in wrack (i.e., seaweed or other marine vegetation) deposited on beaches.  In most areas, wintering piping plovers are dependent on a mosaic of sites distributed throughout the landscape, because the suitability of a particular site for foraging or roosting is dependent on local weather and tidal conditions.  Plovers move among sites as environmental conditions change, and studies have indicated that they generally remain within a 2-mile area.  Major threats to this species include the loss and degradation of habitat due to development, disturbance by humans and pets, and predation."

The Louisiana pinesnake is highly associated with Baird’s pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), a major food source, which is dependent on the same habitat type. Louisiana pinesnakes are most frequently found near or within pocket gopher burrow systems and move from one burrow system to another. Threats to this species include the sharp decline in quality and quantity of open pine forest habitat due to logging, suppression of fire, and short-rotation silviculture, as well as vehicle-related mortality on roads and off-road trails. Historically, the Louisiana pinesnake occurred in portions of west-central Louisiana and east-central Texas. According to our records, the Louisiana pinesnake is currently known to occur in Bienville, Sabine, Natchitoches, and Vernon Parishes, in Louisiana."

In Louisiana, Atlantic sturgeon have been reported at Rigolets Pass, rivers and lakes of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin, the Pearl River System, and adjacent estuarine and marine areas.  Spawning occurs in coastal rivers between late winter and early spring (i.e., March to May).  Adults and sub-adults may be found in those rivers and streams until November, and in estuarine or marine waters during the remainder of the year.  Atlantic sturgeon less than two years old appear to remain in riverine habitats and estuarine areas throughout the year, rather than migrate to marine waters.  Habitat alterations such as those caused by water control structures and navigation projects that limit and prevent spawning, poor water quality, and over-fishing have negatively affected this species."

The gopher tortoise is the only native tortoise found in the southeastern United States.  This species is associated with areas that have well-drained, sandy soils appropriate for burrow establishment, ample sunlight for nesting and egg incubation, and understory vegetation suitable for foraging (i.e., grasses and forbs).  The burrow opening is semicircular or “half-moon” in shape and a low mound of bare soil will be visible immediately in front of the mouth of an active burrow.  Suitable soil types for gopher tortoises include Latonia and Bassfield (highly suitable), Cahaba, Ruston, and Smithdale (less suitable), and Abita, Malbis, Angie, and Prentiss (marginal).  Gopher tortoises prefer “open” longleaf pine-scrub oak communities that are thinned and burned every few years.   Habitat degradation (lack of thinning or burning on pine plantations), predation, and conversion to agriculture or urbanization have contributed to the decline of this species.  That habitat decline has concentrated many remaining gopher tortoise populations along pipeline and power line rights-of-way (ROW) within their range.  Tortoise burrows also can be found along road ROW’s, and other marginal habitats; including fence rows, orchard edges, golf course roughs and edges, old fields, and pasturelands.  Tortoises are often pushed into these areas due to adjacent habitat becoming unsuitable."
